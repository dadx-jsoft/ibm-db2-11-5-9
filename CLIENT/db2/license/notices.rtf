9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\

If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\
\
3.6. Larger Works.\
\
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\
\
4. Versions of the License.\
\
4.1. New Versions.\
\
Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.\
\
4.2. Effect of New Versions.\
\
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\
\
4.3. Modified Versions.\
\
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\
\
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\
\
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\
\
6. TERMINATION.\
\
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\
\
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\
\
6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\
\
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\
\
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\
\
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\
\
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\
\
9. MISCELLANEOUS.\
\
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\
\
\
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\
\
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\

\
\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC\
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\
\
1. DEFINITIONS\
\
"Contribution" means:\
\
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\
\
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\
\
    i) changes to the Program, and\
\
    ii) additions to the Program;\
\
    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\
derivative works of the Program.\
\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\
\
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\
combined with the Program.\
\
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\
\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\
including all Contributors.\
\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\
\
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such\
derivative works, in source code and object code form.\
\
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\
\
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to\
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\
before distributing the Program.\
\
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set\
forth in this Agreement.\
\
3. REQUIREMENTS\
\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\
own license agreement, provided that:\
\
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\
\
    b) its license agreement:\
\
    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and\
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\
fitness for a particular purpose;\
\
    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\
damages, such as lost profits;\
\
    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered\
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\
\
    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or\
through a medium customarily used for software exchange. \
\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\
\
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\
\
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. \
\
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\
Program.\
\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\
originator of the Contribution.\
\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\
\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages\
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\
any such claim at its own expense.\
\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\
Contributor must pay those damages.\
\
5. NO WARRANTY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\
\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
7. GENERAL\
\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\
provision valid and enforceable.\
\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\
survive.\
\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve\
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the\
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its\
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections\
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\
\
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\
any resulting litigation.\

\
3. Distribution Obligations.\
\
     3.1. Application of License.\
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\
\
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\
\
     3.3. Description of Modifications.\
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\
\
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\
          (a) Third Party Claims.\
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\
\
          (b) Contributor APIs.\
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\
\
          (c)    Representations.\
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\
\
     3.5. Required Notices.\
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\
\
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\
\
     3.7. Larger Works.\
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\
\
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\
\
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\
\
5. Application of this License.\
\
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\
\
6. Versions of the License.\
\
     6.1. New Versions.\
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\
\
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\
\
     6.3. Derivative Works.\
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\
\
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\
\
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\
\
8. TERMINATION.\
\
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\
\
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:\
\
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\
\
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\
\
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\
\
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\
\
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\
\
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\
\
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\
\
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\
\
11. MISCELLANEOUS.\
\
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\
\
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\
\
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\
\
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\
\
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\

\
    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\
\
Preamble\
\
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\
\
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\
\
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\
\
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\
\
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\
\
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\
\
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\
\
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\
\
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\
\
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\
\
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\
\
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\
\
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\
\
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\
\
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\
\
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".\
\
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\
\
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)\
\
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\
\
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\
\
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\
\
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\
\
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\
\
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\
\
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\
\
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\
\
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\
\
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\
\
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\
\
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\
\
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. \
\
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\
\
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\
\
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\
\
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\
\
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\
\
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\
\
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\
\
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\
\
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\
\
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\
\
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\
\
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\
\
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\
\
\
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\
\
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\
\
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\
\
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\
\
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\
\
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\
\
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\
\
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\
\
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\
\
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\
\
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\
\
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\
\
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\
\
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\
\
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\
\
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\
\
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\
\
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\
\
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\
\
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\
\
NO WARRANTY\
\
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\
\
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
\
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\
\
\
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\
\
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\
\
    <one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\
\
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\
\
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.\
\
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA \
\
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\
\
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\
\
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\

       the Derivative Works; and\
\
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\

   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\
\
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\
\
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\

   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\

   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\

(d) notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.\
\
3. Distribution Obligations.\
\
3.1. Application of License.\
\
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\
\
3.2. Availability of Source Code.\
\
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\
\
3.3. Description of Modifications.\
\
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\
\
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.\
\
(a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "../LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\
\
(b) Contributor APIs.\
\
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface ("API"../) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\
\
(c) Representations.\
\
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License\
\
.\
3.5. Required Notices.\
\
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\
\
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\
\
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\
\
3.7. Larger Works.\
\
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\
\
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\
\
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\
\
5. Application of this License.\
\
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\
\
6. Versions of the License.\
\
6.1. New Versions.\
 \
\
Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\
6.2. Effect of New Versions.\
\
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\
\
6.3. Derivative Works.\
\
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Sun," "Sun Public License," or "SPL"../ or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\
\
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\
\
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "../AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\
\
8. TERMINATION.\
\
8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\
\
8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:\
\
(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\
\
(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\
\
8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\
\
8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\
\
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\
\
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\
\
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\
\
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation,"../ as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\
\
11. MISCELLANEOUS.\
\
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\
\
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\
\
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\
\
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\
\
   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\
\
   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.\
\
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\
\
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\
   as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\
   meet the following conditions:\
\
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\
\
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\
       stating that You changed the files; and\
\
   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\
       the Derivative Works; and\
\
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\
       as modifying the License.\
\
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\
   the conditions stated in this License.\
\
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\
\
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\
\
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\
\
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\
\
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\

Introduction\
============\
\
  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;\
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,\
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the\
  FreeType Project.\
\
  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and\
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license\
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\
\
  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\
\
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\
\
    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\
\
    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\
      FreeType code. (`credits')\
\

\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC\
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\
\
1. DEFINITIONS\
\
"Contribution" means:\
\
      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\
         documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\
      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\
\
      i) changes to the Program, and\
\
      ii) additions to the Program;\
\
      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are\
not derivative works of the Program. \
\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\
\
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\
combined with the Program.\
\
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\
\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\
including all Contributors.\
\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\
\
      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and\
such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\
\
      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\
Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\
object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the\
Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the\
Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be\
covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any\
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\
licensed hereunder. \
\
      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by\
any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims\
any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on\
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to\
allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to\
acquire that license before distributing the Program.\
\
      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license\
set forth in this Agreement. \
\
3. REQUIREMENTS\
\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\
its own license agreement, provided that:\
\
      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\
\
      b) its license agreement:\
\
      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title\
and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability\
and fitness for a particular purpose; \
\
      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\
damages, such as lost profits; \
\
      iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\
\
      iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on\
or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. \
\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\
\
      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and \
\
      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the\
Program. \
\
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\
Program.\
\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\
originator of the Contribution.\
\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\
\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages\
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor\
to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and\
any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\
participate in any such claim at its own expense.\
\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\
Contributor must pay those damages.\
\
5. NO WARRANTY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\
and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise\
of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and\
costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of\
data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\
\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY\
WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
7. GENERAL\
\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\
provision valid and enforceable.\
\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any\
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights\
granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is\
filed.\
\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\
and survive.\
\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to\
serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version\
of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program\
(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of\
the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of\
the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\
(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated\
in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to\
the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\
\
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial\
in any resulting litigation. \

\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE \
PUBLIC LICENSE (â€œAGREEMENTâ€). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF \
THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\
1. DEFINITIONS\
\
â€œContributionâ€ means:\
\
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content \
Distributed under this Agreement, and\
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\
        i) changes to the Program, and\
        ii) additions to the Program;\
    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from \
and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution \
â€œoriginatesâ€ from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by \
such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's \
behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the \
Program that are not Modified Works.\
\
â€œContributorâ€ means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\
\
â€œLicensed Patentsâ€ mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which \
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone \
or when combined with the Program.\
\
â€œProgramâ€ means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this \
Agreement.\
\
â€œRecipientâ€ means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement \
or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\
\
â€œDerivative Worksâ€ shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other \
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the \
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications \
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\
\
â€œModified Worksâ€ shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that \
results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the \
contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file \
in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified \
Works shall not include works that contain only declarations, \
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely \
in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program \
or Modified Works thereof.\
\
â€œDistributeâ€ means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in \
any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\
\
â€œSource Codeâ€ means the form of a Program preferred for making \
modifications, including but not limited to software source code, \
documentation source, and configuration files.\
\
â€œSecondary Licenseâ€ means either the GNU General Public License, Version \
2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or \
additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\
\
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby \
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright \
license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, \
publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such \
Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby \
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent \
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, \
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, \
if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall \
apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at \
the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition \
of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the \
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other \
combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is \
licensed hereunder.\
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the \
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are \
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the \
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. \
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims \
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual \
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the \
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes \
sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights \
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is \
required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is \
Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before \
distributing the Program.\
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has \
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant \
the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\
    e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no \
Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than \
those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's \
receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if \
permitted under the terms of Section 3).\
\
3. REQUIREMENTS\
\
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\
\
    a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in \
accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the \
Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is \
available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain \
it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used \
for software exchange; and\
    b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license \
different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all \
warranties and conditions, express and implied, including \
warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and \
implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness \
for a particular purpose;\
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all \
liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, \
incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\
        iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights \
in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\
        iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any \
party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of \
this section 3.\
\
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\
\
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program \
(i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made \
available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial \
Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in \
Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available \
under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the \
Program.\
\
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, \
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations \
of liability (â€˜noticesâ€™) contained within the Program from any copy of \
the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add \
their own appropriate notices.\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\
\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities \
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this \
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the \
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering \
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for \
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in \
a commercial product offering, such Contributor (â€œCommercial \
Contributorâ€) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other \
Contributor (â€œIndemnified Contributorâ€) against any losses, damages and \
costs (collectively â€œLossesâ€) arising from claims, lawsuits and other \
legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified \
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such \
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the \
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this \
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or \
alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an \
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial \
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial \
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor \
in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified \
Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\
\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial \
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial \
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance \
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance \
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility \
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to \
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those \
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other \
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor \
must pay those damages.\
5. NO WARRANTY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT \
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN â€œAS ISâ€ \
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR \
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF \
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR \
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the \
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all \
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, \
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, \
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or \
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT \
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS \
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, \
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST \
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN \
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) \
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE \
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE \
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
7. GENERAL\
\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under \
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of \
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action \
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum \
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\
\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including \
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program \
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or \
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's \
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such \
litigation is filed.\
\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails \
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement \
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after \
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under \
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution \
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's \
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient \
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\
\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, \
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may \
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves \
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this \
Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has \
the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the \
initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the \
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate \
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing \
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be \
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was \
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is \
published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including \
its Contributions) under the new version.\
\
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient \
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any \
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, \
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted \
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended \
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. \
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\
Exhibit A â€“ Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\
\
â€œThis Source Code may also be made available under the following \
Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth \
in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), \
version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.â€\
\
    Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A \
is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\
\
    If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular \
file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a \
LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be \
likely to look for such a notice.\
\
    You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\

\
Common Public License Version 1.0\
[OSI Approved License]\
\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC\
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\
\
1. DEFINITIONS\
\
"Contribution" means:\
\
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\
\
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\
\
i) changes to the Program, and\
\
ii) additions to the Program;\
\
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\
derivative works of the Program.\
\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\
\
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\
combined with the Program.\
\
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\
\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\
including all Contributors.\
\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\
\
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such\
derivative works, in source code and object code form.\
\
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\
\
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to\
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\
before distributing the Program.\
\
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set\
forth in this Agreement.\
\
3. REQUIREMENTS\
\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\
own license agreement, provided that:\
\
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\
\
b) its license agreement:\
\
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and\
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\
fitness for a particular purpose;\
\
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\
damages, such as lost profits;\
\
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered\
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\
\
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or\
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\
\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\
\
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\
\
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\
\
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\
Program.\
\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\
originator of the Contribution.\
\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\
\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages\
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\
any such claim at its own expense.\
\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\
Contributor must pay those damages.\
\
5. NO WARRANTY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\
\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
7. GENERAL\
\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\
provision valid and enforceable.\
\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\
survive.\
\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve\
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the\
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its\
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections\
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\
\
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\
any resulting litigation.\

\
This is the header file for the MD5 message-digest algorithm.\
The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was\
written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.\
This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.\
\
Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.\
This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,\
except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese\
with every copy.\
\
To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an\
MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as\
needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which\
will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.\
\
Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h'\
header definitions; now uses stuff from dpkg's config.h\
 - Ian Jackson <ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu>.\
Still in the public domain.\

The Academic Free License, v. 2.1:\
**********************************\
\
This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of\
authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the\
following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original\
Work:\
\
Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1\
\
1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,\
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the\
following:\
\
a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;\
\
b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original\
Work;\
\
c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the\
public;\
\
d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\
\
e) to display the Original Work publicly.\
\
2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,\
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent\
claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original\
Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the\
Original Work and Derivative Works.\
\
3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred\
form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available\
documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby\
agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original\
Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.\
Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a\
machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository\
reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as\
long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing\
the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following\
the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.\
\
4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names\
of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or\
service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\
Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing\
in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,\
patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as\
expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or\
offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims\
defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if\
such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be\
interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this\
License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to\
license.\
\
5) This section intentionally omitted.\
\
6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative\
Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the\
Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any\
descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause\
the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent\
Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have\
modified the Original Work.\
\
7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that\
the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein\
by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms\
of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights\
and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding\
sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS\
and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,\
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.\
This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No\
license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.\
\
8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,\
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the\
Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,\
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License\
or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss\
of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not\
apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's\
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some\
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\
\
9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or\
a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to\
obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing\
else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)\
grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work\
or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt\
to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement\
between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the\
equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by\
exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate\
Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\
\
10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically\
and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License\
as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\
against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a\
patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging\
patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or\
hardware.\
\
11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this\
License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the\
Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under\
the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the\
scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the\
requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et\
seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This\
section shall survive the termination of this License.\
\
12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or\
seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\
recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable\
attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including\
any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this\
License.\
\
13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning\
the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to\
make it enforceable.\
\
14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether\
in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights\
under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal\
entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is\
under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means\
(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such\
entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent\
(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such\
entity.\
\
15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise\
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not\
to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\

NFS-Ganesha clarifications:\
\
The conditions set below apply only to the Cmake specific files in this\
directory.  They do not apply to the NFS-ganesha project as a whole.  See\
the top level licensing documentation for details about NFS-Ganesha licensing.\
\
Some scripts in this directory are a combination of modules copied from \
other cmake projects, net forums, or HOWTOs.  Any files that were copied\
were, to the best of our ability, audited to have a proper open source\
license or come from a project with an appropriate open source license.\
Where the author placed a license clause in the cmake file, this has been\
preserved.\
\
If a file in this directory does not have a license notice attached,\
the following Cmake appropriate license and disclaimer applies.  This\
is for the convenience of other developers who wish to use these files\
in their own open source projects.\

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation\
      source, and configuration files.\
\
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\
      and conversions to other media types.\
\
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\
\
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\
\
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\
\
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\
\
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\
\
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\
      meet the following conditions:\
\
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\
\
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\
          stating that You changed the files; and\
\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\
          the Derivative Works; and\
\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\
          as modifying the License.\
\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\
      the conditions stated in this License.\
\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\
\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\
\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\
\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\
\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\
\
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\

\
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,\
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation\
      source, and configuration files.\
\
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\
      and conversions to other media types.\
\
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\
\
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\
\
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\
\
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\
\
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\
\
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\
      meet the following conditions:\
\
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\
\
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\
          stating that You changed the files; and\
\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\
          the Derivative Works; and\
\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\
          as modifying the License.\
\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\
      the conditions stated in this License.\
\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\
\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\
\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\
\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\
\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\
\

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE \
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY \
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS \
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. \
\
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE \
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE \
RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS \
AND CONDITIONS. \
\
\
\
1. Definitions\
\
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or \
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, \
along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and \
independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. \
A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a \
Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License. \
\
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and \
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, \
dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound \
recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form \
in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a \
work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a \
Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of \
doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the \
synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image \
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of \
this License. \
\
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the \
terms of this License. \
\
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work. \
\
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the \
terms of this License. \
\
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License \
who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect \
to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to \
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. \
\
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, \
limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other \
limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under \
copyright law or other applicable laws. \
\
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, \
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, \

exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: \
\
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more \
Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the \

publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission \
the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works; to distribute \
copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and \
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative \
Works. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical \
composition: \
\
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the \
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance \
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public \
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work. \
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive \
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or \

Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions). \
\

where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right \
to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society \
(e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. \
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 \
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other \
jurisdictions). The above rights may be exercised in all media and \
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include \
the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to \
exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly \
granted by Licensor are hereby reserved. \
\
4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made \
subject to and limited by the following restrictions: \
\
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly \
digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You \
must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this \
License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, \
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You \

hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all \
notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. \
You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly \
digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control \
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of \
this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in \
a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart \
from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If \
You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to \
the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as \
required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, \
upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, \

parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for \
attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other \
reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the \
Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform \
Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated \
with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or \
licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative \
Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work \
(e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or \
"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may \
be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the \
case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit \
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in \
a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship \
credit. \
\
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer \
\
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR \
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY \
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, \
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, \
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF \
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, \

THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED \
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. \
\
7. Termination \
\
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate \
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. \
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective \
Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses \
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full \
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will \
survive any termination of this License. Subject to the above terms and \
conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of \
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, \
Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license \
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however \
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any \
other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the \
terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and \
effect unless terminated as stated above. \
\
8. Miscellaneous \

perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to \
the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license \
granted to You under this License. If any provision of this License is \
invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the \
validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this \
License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, \
such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make \
such provision valid and enforceable. No term or provision of this \
License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such \
waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be \
charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire \
agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. \

to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any \
additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. \

the Licensor and You. \

    1. Definitions\
\

        cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be\
        recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably\
        derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a\
        Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of\
        this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical\
        work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in\
        timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an\
        Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\
     b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as\
        encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or\
        broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed\
        in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and\
        arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in\
        which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along\
        with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and\
        independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a\
        collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be\
        considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this\
        License.\
     c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and\
        copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or\
        other transfer of ownership.\

        offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\

        musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,\

        expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer\

        of this License including without limitation any production in the\
        literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or\
        form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,\
        pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work\
        of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a\
        choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical\
        composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are\

        lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works\
        expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied\
        art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work\

        considered a literary or artistic work.\
     g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\
        License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with\
        respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the\
        Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous\
        violation.\
     h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and\
        to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or\
        process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital\

        members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a\
        place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public\
        by any means or process and the communication to the public of the\

        fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a\
        protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic\
        medium.\
\
    2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,\
    limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from\
    limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the\
    copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\
\
    3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\
    Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\
    exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\
\
     a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\
        Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\
        Collections;\
     b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,\
        including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to\
        clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made\
        to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The\
        original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a\
        modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";\
     c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated\
        in Collections; and,\
     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\
     e. For the avoidance of doubt:\
\
         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\
            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\
            compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\
            reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\
            exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\
        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\
            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\
            compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\
            exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\
            of the rights granted under this License; and,\
       iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to\
            collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\
            Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers\
            voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\
            by You of the rights granted under this License.\
\
    The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\
    known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\
    such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in\
    other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly\
    granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\
\
    4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\
    subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\
\
     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\
        of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\
        Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\
        Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms\
        on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of\
        the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\
        recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the\
        Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and\
        to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\
        Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\
        Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological\
        measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the\
        Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\
        the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as\
        incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection\
        apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\
        License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\
        must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit\
        as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an\
        Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\
        practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\
        Section 4(b), as requested.\
     b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\
        Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\
        Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\
        provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\
        name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\
        and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party\
        or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\
        attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,\
        terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party\
        or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\
        extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\
        specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\
        refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\
        and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\
        a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\
        "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay\
        based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by\
        this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\
        provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at\
        a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\
        authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these\
        credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the\
        other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\
        use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\
        in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\
        License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\
        connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\
        Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\
        use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\
        permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\
        Parties.\
     c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\
        otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\
        Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\
        Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or\
        take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\
        prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor\
        agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\
        of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to\
        make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\
        modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\
        Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,\
        as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\
        applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your\
        right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\
        but not otherwise.\
\
    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\
\
    UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\
    OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\
    KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\
    LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,\
    WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION\
    OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\
\
    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\
    LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\
    ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\
    ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\
    BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
    7. Termination\
\
     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\
        automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\
        Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\
        from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\
        terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\
        compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\
        survive any termination of this License.\
     b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\
        perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\
        Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\
        Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\
        any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\
        withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\
        required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\
        License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\
        stated above.\
\
    8. Miscellaneous\
\
     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,\
        the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same\
        terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\
     b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\
        offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\
        terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\
     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\
        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\
        the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\
        by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\
        the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\
        enforceable.\
     d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\
        breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\
        and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\
     e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\
        respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\
        agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\
        here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\
        may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\
        modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\
     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\
        License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\
        for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\
        September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\
        Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996\
        and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\
        These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\
        jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\
        according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of\
        those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the\
        standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\
        includes additional rights not granted under this License, such\
        additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this\
        License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under\
        applicable law.\

   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE \
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY \
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS \
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. \
\
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE \
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE \
RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS \
AND CONDITIONS. \
\
\
\
1. Definitions\
\
"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or \
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, \
along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and \
independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. \
A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a \
Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License. \
\
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and \
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, \
dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound \
recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form \
in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a \
work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a \
Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of \
doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the \
synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image \
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of \
this License. \
\
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the \
terms of this License. \
\
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work. \
\
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the \
terms of this License. \
\
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License \
who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect \
to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to \
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. \
\
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, \
limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other \
limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under \
copyright law or other applicable laws. \
\
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, \
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, \
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to \
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: \
\
to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more \
Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the \
Collective Works; to create and reproduce Derivative Works; to \
distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform \
publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission \
the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works; to distribute \
copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and \
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative \
Works. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical \
composition: \
\
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the \
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance \
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public \
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work. \
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive \
right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or \
designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord \

the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright \
Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions). \
\
Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, \
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right \
to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society \
(e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. \
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 \
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other \
jurisdictions). The above rights may be exercised in all media and \
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include \
the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to \
exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly \
granted by Licensor are hereby reserved. \
\
4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made \
subject to and limited by the following restrictions: \
\
You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly \
digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You \
must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this \
License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, \
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You \
may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the \
terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted \
hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all \
notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. \
You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly \
digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control \
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of \
this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in \
a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart \
from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If \
You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to \
the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as \
required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, \
upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, \
remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), \
as requested. \
\
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly \
digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, \
You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, \
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the \
Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) \
if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or \
parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for \
attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other \
reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the \
Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform \
Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated \
with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or \
licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative \
Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work \
(e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or \
"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may \
be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the \
case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit \
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in \
a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship \
credit. \
\
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer \
\
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR \
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY \
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, \
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, \
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF \
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, \
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE \
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. \
\
6. Limitation on Liability. \
\
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL \
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, \
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF \
THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED \
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. \
\
7. Termination \
\
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate \
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. \
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective \
Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses \
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full \
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will \
survive any termination of this License. Subject to the above terms and \
conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of \
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, \
Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license \
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however \
that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any \
other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the \
terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and \
effect unless terminated as stated above. \
\
8. Miscellaneous \
\
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a \
Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the \
Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You \
under this License. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally \
perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to \
the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license \
granted to You under this License. If any provision of this License is \
invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the \
validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this \
License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, \
such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make \
such provision valid and enforceable. No term or provision of this \
License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such \
waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be \
charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire \
agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. \
There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect \
to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any \
additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. \
This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of \
the Licensor and You. \

\
    1. Definitions\
\

        literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes\
        cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be\
        recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably\
        derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a\
        Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of\
        this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical\
        work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in\
        timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an\
        Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\
     b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as\
        encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or\
        broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed\
        in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and\
        arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in\
        which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along\
        with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and\
        independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a\
        collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be\
        considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this\
        License.\
     c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and\
        copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or\
        other transfer of ownership.\

        offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\

        addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,\
        musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,\

        expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer\

        of this License including without limitation any production in the\
        literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or\
        form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,\
        pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work\
        of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a\
        choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical\
        composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are\
        assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;\
        a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or\
        lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works\
        expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied\
        art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work\
        relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a\

        a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise\
        considered a literary or artistic work.\
     g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\
        License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with\
        respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the\
        Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous\
        violation.\
     h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and\
        to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or\
        process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital\

        members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a\
        place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public\
        by any means or process and the communication to the public of the\
        performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to\

     i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including\
        without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of\
        fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a\
        protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic\
        medium.\
\
    2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,\
    limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from\
    limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the\
    copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\
\
    3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\
    Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\
    exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\
\
     a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\
        Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\
        Collections;\
     b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,\
        including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to\
        clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made\
        to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The\
        original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a\
        modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";\
     c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated\
        in Collections; and,\
     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\
     e. For the avoidance of doubt:\
\
         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\
            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\
            compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\
            reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\
            exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\
        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\
            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\
            compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\
            exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\
            of the rights granted under this License; and,\
       iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to\
            collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\
            Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers\
            voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\
            by You of the rights granted under this License.\
\
    The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\
    known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\
    such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in\
    other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly\
    granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\
\
    4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\
    subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\
\
     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\
        of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\
        Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\
        Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms\
        on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of\
        the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\
        recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the\
        Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and\
        to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\
        Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\
        Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological\
        measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the\
        Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\
        the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as\
        incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection\
        apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\
        License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\
        must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit\
        as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an\
        Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\
        practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\
        Section 4(b), as requested.\
     b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\
        Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\
        Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\
        provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\
        name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\
        and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party\
        or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\
        attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,\
        terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party\
        or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\
        extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\
        specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\
        refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\
        and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\
        a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\
        "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay\
        based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by\
        this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\
        provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at\
        a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\
        authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these\
        credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the\
        other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\
        use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\
        in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\
        License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\
        connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\
        Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\
        use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\
        permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\
        Parties.\
     c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\
        otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\
        Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\
        Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or\
        take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\
        prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor\
        agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\
        of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to\
        make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\
        modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\
        Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,\
        as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\
        applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your\
        right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\
        but not otherwise.\
\
    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\
\
    UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\
    OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\
    KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\
    LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,\
    WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION\
    OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\
\
    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\
    LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\
    ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\
    ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\
    BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
    7. Termination\
\
     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\
        automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\
        Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\
        from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\
        terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\
        compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\
        survive any termination of this License.\
     b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\
        perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\
        Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\
        Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\
        any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\
        withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\
        required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\
        License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\
        stated above.\
\
    8. Miscellaneous\
\
     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,\
        the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same\
        terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\
     b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\
        offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\
        terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\
     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\
        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\
        the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\
        by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\
        the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\
        enforceable.\
     d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\
        breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\
        and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\
     e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\
        respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\
        agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\
        here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\
        may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\
        modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\
     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\
        License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\
        for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\
        September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\
        Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996\
        and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\
        These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\
        jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\
        according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of\
        those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the\
        standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\
        includes additional rights not granted under this License, such\
        additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this\
        License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under\
        applicable law.\

        license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative\

GPL version 3\
=============\
\
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\
\
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\
\
                            Preamble\
\
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\
software and other kinds of works.\
\
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\
your programs, too.\
\
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\
\
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\
\
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\
know their rights.\
\
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\
\
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\
authors of previous versions.\
\
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\
\
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\
\
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\
modification follow.\
\
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\
\
  0. Definitions.\
\
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\
\
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\
works, such as semiconductor masks.\
\
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and\
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.\
\
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the\
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.\
\
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\
on the Program.\
\
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without\
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\
public, and in some countries other activities as well.\
\
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\
\
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"\
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\
\
  1. Source Code.\
\
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work\
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source\
form of a work.\
\
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official\
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\
is widely used among developers working in that language.\
\
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other\
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component\
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\
\
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all\
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\
includes interface definition files associated with source files for\
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\
subprograms and other parts of the work.\
\
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\
Source.\
\
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\
same work.\
\
  2. Basic Permissions.\
\
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\
\
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\
\
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\
makes it unnecessary.\
\
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\
\
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\
measures.\
\
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\
technological measures.\
\
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\
\
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\
\
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\
\
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\
\
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\
\
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\
    it, and giving a relevant date.\
\
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\
    released under this License and any conditions added under section\
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\
    "keep intact all notices".\
\
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\
\
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\
    work need not make them do so.\
\
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\
parts of the aggregate.\
\
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\
\
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\
in one of these ways:\
\
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\
    customarily used for software interchange.\
\
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\
\
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\
    with subsection 6b.\
\
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\
\
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\
    charge under subsection 6d.\
\
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\
included in conveying the object code work.\
\
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any\
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a\
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\
the only significant mode of use of the product.\
\
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,\
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\
modification has been made.\
\
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\
been installed in ROM).\
\
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\
protocols for communication across the network.\
\
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\
source code form), and must require no special password or key for\
unpacking, reading or copying.\
\
  7. Additional Terms.\
\
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this\
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\
this License without regard to the additional permissions.\
\
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\
\
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\
\
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\
\
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\
\
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\
\
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\
    authors of the material; or\
\
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\
\
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\
    those licensors and authors.\
\
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further\
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\
governed by this License along with a term that is a further\
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\
not survive such relicensing or conveying.\
\
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\
where to find the applicable terms.\
\
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\
the above requirements apply either way.\
\
  8. Termination.\
\
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\
paragraph of section 11).\
\
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\
prior to 60 days after the cessation.\
\
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\
your receipt of the notice.\
\
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\
material under section 10.\
\
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\
\
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\
\
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\
\
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\
\
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an\
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\
\
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\
\
  11. Patents.\
\
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".\
\
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims\
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant\
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\
this License.\
\
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\
propagate the contents of its contributor version.\
\
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express\
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a\
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\
patent against the party.\
\
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have\
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\
country that you have reason to believe are valid.\
\
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\
work and works based on it.\
\
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within\
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\
\
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\
\
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\
\
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\
\
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\
\
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\
combination as such.\
\
  14. Revised Versions of this License.\
\
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\
address new problems or concerns.\
\
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the\
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\
version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\
by the Free Software Foundation.\
\
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\
to choose that version for the Program.\
\
  Later license versions may give you additional or different\
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\
later version.\
\
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\
\
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\
\
  16. Limitation of Liability.\
\
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\
SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\
\
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\
copy of the Program in return for a fee.\

        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,\

        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as\
        part of a Larger Work; and\
\
     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for\

        or its Contributor Version.\
\
2.2. Effective Date\
\
     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become\
     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes\
     such Contribution.\
\
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\
\
     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this\
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution\
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section\
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\
\
     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\
\
     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third partyâ€™s\
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\
        Version); or\
\
     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its\
        Contributions.\
\
     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or\
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the\
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).\
\
2.4. Subsequent Licenses\
\
     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License\
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted\
     under the terms of Section 3.3).\
\
2.5. Representation\
\
     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions\
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the\
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\
\
2.6. Fair Use\
\
     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\
\
2.7. Conditions\
\
     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\
     Section 2.1.\
\
\
3. Responsibilities\
\
3.1. Distribution of Source Form\
\
     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\
     restrict the recipientsâ€™ rights in the Source Code Form.\
\
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\
\
     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\
\
     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\
        of distribution to the recipient; and\
\
     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipientsâ€™\
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\
\
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\
\
     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).\
\
3.4. Notices\
\
     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\
\
3.5. Application of Additional Terms\
\
     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\
     jurisdiction.\
\
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\
\
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\
   understand it.\
\
5. Termination\
\
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\
\
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\
     shall terminate.\
\
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\
     termination shall survive termination.\
\
6. Disclaimer of Warranty\
\
   Covered Software is provided under this License on an â€œas isâ€ basis, without\
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\
   except under this disclaimer.\
\
7. Limitation of Liability\
\
   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\
   partyâ€™s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\
\
8. Litigation\
\
   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\
   prevent a partyâ€™s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\
\
9. Miscellaneous\
\
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\
   this License against a Contributor.\
\
\
10. Versions of the License\
\
10.1. New Versions\
\
      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\
      distinguishing version number.\
\
10.2. Effect of New Versions\

     such Contribution.\
\

\
     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this\
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution\
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section\
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\

        Version); or\
\
     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its\
        Contributions.\
\
     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or\
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the\
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).\
\
2.4. Subsequent Licenses\
\
     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License\
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted\
     under the terms of Section 3.3).\
\
2.5. Representation\
\
     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions\
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the\
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\
\
2.6. Fair Use\
\
     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\
\
2.7. Conditions\
\
     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\
     Section 2.1.\
\
\
3. Responsibilities\
\
3.1. Distribution of Source Form\
\
     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\
     restrict the recipientsâ€™ rights in the Source Code Form.\
\
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\
\
     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\
\
     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\
        of distribution to the recipient; and\
\
     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipientsâ€™\
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\
\
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\
\
     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).\
\
3.4. Notices\
\
     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\
\
3.5. Application of Additional Terms\
\
     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\
     jurisdiction.\
\
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\
\
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\
   understand it.\
\
5. Termination\
\
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\
\
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\
     shall terminate.\
\
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\
     termination shall survive termination.\
\
6. Disclaimer of Warranty\
\
   Covered Software is provided under this License on an â€œas isâ€ basis, without\
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\
   except under this disclaimer.\
\
7. Limitation of Liability\
\
   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\
   partyâ€™s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\
\
8. Litigation\
\
   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\
   prevent a partyâ€™s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\
\
9. Miscellaneous\
\
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\
   this License against a Contributor.\
\
\
10. Versions of the License\
\
10.1. New Versions\
\
      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\
      distinguishing version number.\
\
10.2. Effect of New Versions\
\
      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of\
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or\
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\
      steward.\
\
10.3. Modified Versions\
\
      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\
      modified license differs from this License).\
\
10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\
\

3. Responsibilities\
-------------------\
\
3.1. Distribution of Source Form\
\
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\
Form.\
\
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\

\
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\

provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\

or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\
\
3.5. Application of Additional Terms\
\
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\
jurisdiction.\
\
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\
---------------------------------------------------\
\
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\
\
5. Termination\
--------------\
\
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\
Your receipt of the notice.\
\
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\
2.1 of this License shall terminate.\
\
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\
prior to termination shall survive termination.\

-------------------\
\
3.1. Distribution of Source Form\
\
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\
Form.\
\
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\
\
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\
\
(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\
\
(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\
\
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\
\
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\
License(s).\
\
3.4. Notices\
\
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\

the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\

3.5. Application of Additional Terms\
\
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\
jurisdiction.\
\
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\
---------------------------------------------------\
\
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\
\
5. Termination\
--------------\
\
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\
Your receipt of the notice.\
\
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\
2.1 of this License shall terminate.\
\
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\

prior to termination shall survive termination.\

\
Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\
non-exclusive license:\
\
(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)\
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,\
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its\
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or\

    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its\
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.\
\
2.2. Effective Date\
\
The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\
distributes such Contribution.\
\
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\
\
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\
Contributor:\
\
(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\
    or\
\
(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\
    Version); or\
\
(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\
    its Contributions.\
\
This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\
\
2.4. Subsequent Licenses\
\
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\
\
2.5. Representation\
\
Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\
\
2.6. Fair Use\
\
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\
equivalents.\
\
2.7. Conditions\
\
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\
in Section 2.1.\
\
3. Responsibilities\
-------------------\
\
3.1. Distribution of Source Form\
\
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\
Form.\
\
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\
\
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\
\
(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\
\
(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\
\
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\
\
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\
License(s).\
\
3.4. Notices\
\
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\
\
3.5. Application of Additional Terms\
\
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\
jurisdiction.\
\
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\
---------------------------------------------------\
\
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\
\
5. Termination\
--------------\
\
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\
Your receipt of the notice.\
\
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\
2.1 of this License shall terminate.\
\
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\
prior to termination shall survive termination.\

*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *\
*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *\
*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *\
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *\
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *\
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *\
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *\
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *\
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *\
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *\
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *\
*                                                                      *\

*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *\

*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *\

*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *\
*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *\

*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *\
*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *\
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *\

*                                                                      *\
************************************************************************\
\
8. Litigation\
-------------\
\
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\
cross-claims or counter-claims.\
\
9. Miscellaneous\
----------------\
\
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\
\
10. Versions of the License\
---------------------------\
\
10.1. New Versions\
\

\
If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\
such modified license differs from this License).\

\
2.2. Effective Date\
\
     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\
     become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\
     distributes such Contribution.\
\
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\
\
     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\
     this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\
     distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\
     Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\
     Contributor:\
\
     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\
\
     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\
        Version); or\
\
     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\
        its Contributions.\
\
     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\
     or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\
     the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\
\
2.4. Subsequent Licenses\
\
     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\
     License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\
     permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\
\
2.5. Representation\
\
     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\
     Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to\
     grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\
\
2.6. Fair Use\
\
     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\
     applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\
     equivalents.\
\
2.7. Conditions\
\
     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\
     Section 2.1.\
\
\
3. Responsibilities\
\
3.1. Distribution of Source Form\
\
     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\
     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\
     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\
     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\
     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\
     Form.\
\
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\
\
     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\
\
     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\
        of distribution to the recipient; and\
\
     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\
        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\
        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the\
        recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\
\
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\
\
     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\
     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\
     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\
     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\
     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\
     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\
     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\
     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\
     License(s).\
\
3.4. Notices\
\
     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\
     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or\
     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the\
     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the\
     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\
\
3.5. Application of Additional Terms\
\
     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\
     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\
     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\
     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\
     jurisdiction.\
\
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\
\
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,\
   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\
   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a\
   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under\
   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\
   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary\
   skill to be able to understand it.\
\
5. Termination\
\
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing\
     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by\
     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into\
     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are\
     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the\
     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have\
     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such\
     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt\
     of the notice.\
\
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\
     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\
     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\
     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\
     2.1 of this License shall terminate.\
\
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\
     termination shall survive termination.\
\
6. Disclaimer of Warranty\
\
   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,\
   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,\
   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free\
   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.\
   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software\
   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,\
   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\
   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential\
   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under\
   this License except under this disclaimer.\
\
7. Limitation of Liability\
\
   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\
   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\
   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\
   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may\
   not apply to You.\
\
8. Litigation\
\
   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts\
   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of\
   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\
   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing\
   in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or\
   counter-claims.\
\
9. Miscellaneous\
\
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\
   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that\
   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not\
   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\
\
\
10. Versions of the License\
\
10.1. New Versions\
\
      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\
      distinguishing version number.\
\
10.2. Effect of New Versions\
\
      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\
      of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\
      or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\
      steward.\
\
10.3. Modified Versions\
\
      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\
      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\
      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\
      such modified license differs from this License).\
\
10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\
      Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is\
      Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of\
      the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be\
      attached.\
\
Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\
\

        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,\

\
2.2. Effective Date\
\
     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\
     become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\
     distributes such Contribution.\
\
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\
\
     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\
     this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\
     distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\
     Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\
     Contributor:\
\
     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\
\
     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\
        Version); or\
\
     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\
        its Contributions.\
\
     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\
     or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\
     the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\
\
2.4. Subsequent Licenses\
\
     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\
     License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\
     permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\
\
2.5. Representation\
\
     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\
     Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to\
     grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\
\
2.6. Fair Use\
\
     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\
     applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\
     equivalents.\
\
2.7. Conditions\
\
     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\
     Section 2.1.\
\
\
3. Responsibilities\
\
3.1. Distribution of Source Form\
\
     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\
     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\
     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\
     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\
     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\
     Form.\
\
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\
\
     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\
\
     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\
        of distribution to the recipient; and\
\
     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\
        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\
        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the\
        recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\
\
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\
\
     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\
     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\
     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\
     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\
     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\
     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\
     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\
     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\
     License(s).\
\
3.4. Notices\
\
     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\
     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or\
     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the\
     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the\
     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\
\
3.5. Application of Additional Terms\
\
     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\
     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\
     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\
     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\
     jurisdiction.\
\
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\
\
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,\
   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\
   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a\
   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under\
   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\
   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary\
   skill to be able to understand it.\
\
5. Termination\
\
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing\
     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by\
     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into\
     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are\
     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the\
     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have\
     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such\
     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt\
     of the notice.\
\
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\
     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\
     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\
     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\
     2.1 of this License shall terminate.\
\
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\
     termination shall survive termination.\
\
6. Disclaimer of Warranty\
\
   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,\
   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,\
   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free\
   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.\
   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software\
   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,\
   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\
   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential\
   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under\
   this License except under this disclaimer.\
\
7. Limitation of Liability\
\
   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\
   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\
   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\
   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may\
   not apply to You.\
\
8. Litigation\
\
   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts\
   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of\
   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\
   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing\
   in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or\
   counter-claims.\
\
9. Miscellaneous\
\
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\
   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that\
   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not\
   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\
\
\
10. Versions of the License\
\
10.1. New Versions\
\
      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\
      distinguishing version number.\
\
10.2. Effect of New Versions\
\
      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\
      of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\
      or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\
      steward.\
\
10.3. Modified Versions\
\
      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\
      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\
      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\
      such modified license differs from this License).\
\
10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\
      Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is\
      Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of\
      the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be\
      attached.\

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\
i) changes to the Program, and\
ii) additions to the Program;\
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\

This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\
3. REQUIREMENTS\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\
b) its license agreement:\
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\
5. NO WARRANTY\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
7. GENERAL\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\

more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly\
the order listed) before diving into the code.\
\
\
OVERVIEW\
========\
\
This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and\
decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression\
method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing\
"real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images\
are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not\
exactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you\
have to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images,\
very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and\
remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a\
low-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just experiment\
with various compression settings.\
\
This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive\
compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these\
processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.\
For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding\
variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for supporting\
the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.\
\
We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,\
plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to\
perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.\
The library is intended to be reused in other applications.\
\
In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included\
considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;\
for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG\
decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or\
colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the\
library if not required for a particular application.  We have also included\
"jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG\
processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple applications for\
inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.\
\
The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and\
flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,\
the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the\
REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to\
be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have\
achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.\
\
We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.\
No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product\
documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.\
\
\
LEGAL ISSUES\
============\
\
In plain English:\
\
1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,\
   please let us know!)\
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.\
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a\
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that\
   you've used the IJG code.\
\
In legalese:\
\
The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,\
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or\
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,\
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.\
\
This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.\
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.\
\
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this\
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these\
conditions:\
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this\
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice\
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files\
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.\
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying\
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of\
the Independent JPEG Group".\
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts\
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept\
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.\
\
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,\
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to\
acknowledge us.\
\
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name\
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from\
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's\
software".\
\
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of\
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are\
assumed by the product vendor.\
\
\
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,\
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.\
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead\
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,\
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file\
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part\
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than\
the foregoing paragraphs do.\
\
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.\
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.\
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,\
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright\
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\
\
It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by\
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot\
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,\
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.\
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented\
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)\
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining\
code.\
\
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.\
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has\
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce\
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the\
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard\
GIF decoders.\
\
We are required to state that\
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of\
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of\
    CompuServe Incorporated."\
\
\
REFERENCES\
==========\
\
We highly recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to\
understand the innards of the JPEG software.\
\
The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is\
	Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",\
	Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.\
(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,\
applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue\
handy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is\
available at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz.  The file (actually\
a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)\
omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections\
and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,\
and it may not be used for commercial purposes.\
\
A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in\
"The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by\
M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides\
good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods\
including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C\
code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG\
sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look\
at a full implementation, you've got one here...\
\
The best full description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still Image Data\
Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published\
by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp.\
The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1\
and draft DIS 10918-2).  This is by far the most complete exposition of JPEG\
in existence, and we highly recommend it.\
\
The JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must order a\
paper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel a need to own a certified\
official copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead;\
it's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory material.)\
In the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212)\
642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI\
doesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  It's not cheap: as of\
1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7%\
shipping/handling.  The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the\
actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1\
is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,\
Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS\
10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of\
Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document\
numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.\
\
Some extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3,\
a newer ISO standard numbered ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 and ITU-T T.84.  IJG\
currently does not support any Part 3 extensions.\
\
The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file\
format.  For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision\
1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is available from:\
	Literature Department\
	C-Cube Microsystems, Inc.\
	1778 McCarthy Blvd.\
	Milpitas, CA 95035\
	phone (408) 944-6300,  fax (408) 944-6314\
A PostScript version of this document is available by FTP at\
ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text\
version at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing\
the figures.\
\
The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from\
ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme\
found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.\
IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).\
Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2\
(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from ftp.sgi.com or\
from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that the next revision\
of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.\
Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library\
uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is available\
from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/.\
\
\
ARCHIVE LOCATIONS\
=================\
\
The "official" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet\
address 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be found\
there in directory graphics/jpeg.  This particular version will be archived\
as ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz.  If you don't have\
direct Internet access, UUNET's archives are also available via UUCP; contact\
help@uunet.uu.net for information on retrieving files that way.\
\
Numerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files.  However, only\
ftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest official version.\
\
You can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible "zip" archive format from\
the SimTel archives (ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/), or\
on CompuServe in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12\
"JPEG Tools".  Again, these versions may sometimes lag behind the ftp.uu.net\
release.\
\
The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source of\
general information about JPEG.  It is updated constantly and therefore is\
not included in this distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks to\
Usenet newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups.\
It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/\
and other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers\
archive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/.\

\
\
RELATED SOFTWARE\
================\
\
Numerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support JPEG.  (Quite a\
few of them use this library to do so.)  The JPEG FAQ described above lists\
some of the more popular free and shareware viewers, and tells where to\
obtain them on Internet.\
\
If you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef Poskanzer's free\
PBMPLUS software, which provides many useful operations on PPM-format image\
files.  In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a wide range of\
other formats, thus making cjpeg/djpeg considerably more useful.  The latest\
version is distributed by the NetPBM group, and is available from numerous\
sites, notably ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/.\
Unfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG software is;\
you are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix machine.\
\
A different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford,\
is available from ftp://havefun.stanford.edu/pub/jpeg/.  This program\
is designed for research and experimentation rather than production use;\
it is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but it\
is easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG,\
which we do not.  (On the other hand, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)\
\
\
FILE FORMAT WARS\
================\
\
Some JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our library.\
The root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to specify a\
concrete file format.  Some vendors "filled in the blanks" on their own,\
creating proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For example, none\
of the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were able to\
exchange compressed files.)\
\
The file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This format\
has been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has\
become the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or "low end" representation.\
We recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF\
Technical Note #2) for "high end" applications that need to record a lot of\
additional data about an image.  TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely\
supported, unfortunately.\
\
The upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF.\
SPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders should\
be able to read the most common variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some technical\
advantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an\
official standard rather than an informal one.  At this point it is unclear\
whether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the de-facto\
standard.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we\
have not decided whether it should become our default output format or not.\
(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF indefinitely.)\
\
Various proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also exist.\
We have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats.  Indeed,\
one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help\
force convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files.  Don't\
use a proprietary file format!\
\
The major thrust for v7 will probably be improvement of visual quality.\
The current method for scaling the quantization tables is known not to be\
very good at low Q values.  We also intend to investigate block boundary\
smoothing, "poor man's variable quantization", and other means of improving\
quality-vs-file-size performance without sacrificing compatibility.\
\
In future versions, we are considering supporting some of the upcoming JPEG\
Part 3 extensions --- principally, variable quantization and the SPIFF file\
format.\
\
As always, speeding things up is of great interest.\

 ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.\
\
7.  Database Ownership\
\
   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it. Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database, the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,\
   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\

Academic Free License v. 2.1\
\
This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work: \
Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1 \
1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following: \
* to reproduce the Original Work in copies; \
* to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work; \
* to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public; \
* to perform the Original Work publicly; and \
* to display the Original Work publicly. \
2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works. \
3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work. \
4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. \
5) This section intentionally omitted. \
6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work. \
7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer. \
8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You. \
9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. \
10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware. \
11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Ã‚Â§ 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License. \
12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License. \
13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. \
14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. \
15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You. \
This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved. Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without modification. This license may not be modified without the express written permission of its copyright owner. \

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. \
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions: \

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. \

ANTLR 2 License\
\
We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public domain. An individual or company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into commercial software.\
\
We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. \
In addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.\

GNU Lesser General Public License\
Version 2.1, February 1999\
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\
Preamble\
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".\
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)\
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the a pplication does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\
NO WARRANTY\
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. \
<one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\
This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.\
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA \
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\

\
This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use".\
Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common questions about using materials from our site, including specific terms and conditions for packages like libwww, Amaya, and Jigsaw.

          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version; 3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.\
\
3. Distribution Obligations.\
\
     3.1. Application of License.\
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\
\
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\
\
     3.3. Description of Modifications.\
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\
\
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\
          (a) Third Party Claims.\
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\
\
          (b) Contributor APIs.\
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\
\
          (c)    Representations.\
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\
\
     3.5. Required Notices.\
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\
\
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\
\
     3.7. Larger Works.\
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\
\
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\
\
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\
\
5. Application of this License.\
\
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\
\
6. Versions of the License.\
\
     6.1. New Versions.\
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\
\
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\
\
     6.3. Derivative Works.\
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\
\
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\
\
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\
\
8. TERMINATION.\
\
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\
\
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:\
\
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\
\
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\
\
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\
\
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\
\
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\
\
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\
\
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\
\
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\
\
11. MISCELLANEOUS.\
\
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\
\
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\
\
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\
\
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\
\
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\

ABSTRACT\
========\
\
   UPX and UCL are copyrighted software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (hereinafter the "GPL").\
\
   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The\
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\
\
   As a special exception we grant the free usage of UPX for all executables, including commercial programs. See below for details and restrictions.\

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\
==========================\
\
   UPX and the UCL library are free software; you can redistribute them and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU General Public License as\
   published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\

\
\
SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR COMPRESSED EXECUTABLES\
============================================\
\
   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part  of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\
\
   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\
\
   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option) with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\
      distributed by us.\
   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e. the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\
   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied, called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\
\
\
ANNOTATIONS\
===========\
\
  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\
\
  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as, but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\
    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\
\
  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\
    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -  any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious by definition.\
\
  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.\
\
  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.\

\
1. NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit License Agreement\
----------------------------------------\
\
\
Important Notice\
----------------\
\
READ CAREFULLY: This Software License Agreement ("Agreement")\
for NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, including computer software and\
associated documentation ("Software"), is the Agreement which\
governs use of the SOFTWARE of NVIDIA Corporation and its\
subsidiaries ("NVIDIA") downloadable herefrom. By downloading,\
installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, You (as\
defined below) agree to be bound by the terms of this\
Agreement. If You do not agree to the terms of this Agreement,\
do not download the SOFTWARE.\
\
\
Recitals\
--------\
\
Use of NVIDIA's SOFTWARE requires three elements: the\
SOFTWARE, an NVIDIA GPU or application processor ("NVIDIA\
Hardware"), and a computer system. The SOFTWARE is protected\
by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as\
well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The\
SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only licensed for Your\
use, strictly in accordance with this Agreement. The NVIDIA\
Hardware is protected by various patents, and is sold, but\
this Agreement does not cover the sale or use of such\
hardware, since it may not necessarily be sold as a package\
with the SOFTWARE. This Agreement sets forth the terms and\
conditions of the SOFTWARE only.\
\
\
1.1. Definitions\
\
\
1.1.1. Licensee\
\
"You", or "Your" shall mean the entity or individual that\
downloads and uses the SOFTWARE.\
\
\
1.1.2. Redistributable Software\
\
"Redistributable Software" shall mean the redistributable\
libraries referenced in Attachment A of this Agreement.\
\

"SOFTWARE" shall mean the deliverables provided pursuant to\
this Agreement.\
\
\
1.2. Grant of License\
\
\
1.2.1. Rights and Limitations of Grant\
\
Provided that Licensee complies with the terms of this\
Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants Licensee the following\
limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable\
(except as expressly permitted otherwise for Redistributable\
Software in Section 1.2.1.1 and Section 1.2.1.3 of this\
Agreement) right to use the SOFTWARE, with the following\
limitations:\
\
\
1.2.1.1. Redistribution Rights\
\
Licensee may transfer, redistribute, and sublicense certain\
files of the Redistributable SOFTWARE, as defined in\
Attachment A of this Agreement, provided, however, that (a)\
the Redistributable SOFTWARE shall be distributed solely in\
binary form to Licensee's licensees ("Customers") only as a\
component of Licensee's own software products (each, a\
"Licensee Application"); (b) Licensee shall design the\
Licensee Application such that the Redistributable SOFTWARE\
files are installed only in a private (non-shared) directory\
location that is used only by the Licensee Application; (c)\
Licensee shall obtain each Customer's written or clickwrap\
agreement to the license terms under a written, legally\
enforceable agreement that has the effect of protecting the\
SOFTWARE and the rights of NVIDIA under terms no less\
restrictive than this Agreement.\
\
\
1.2.1.2. Usage Rights\
\
Licensee may install and use multiple copies of the SOFTWARE\
on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers,\
and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for\

connection with the Feedback; or (c) Licensee's confidential\
information voluntarily provided to NVIDIA in connection with\
the Feedback, which are retained in the memories of NVIDIA's\
employees, agents, or contractors who have had access to such\
Residuals. Subject to the terms and conditions of this\
Agreement, NVIDIA's employees, agents, or contractors shall\
not be prevented from using Residuals as part of such\
employee's, agent's or contractor's general knowledge, skills,\
experience, talent, and/or expertise. NVIDIA shall not have\

receiving confidential information from other parties that\
maybe similar to the Feedback and Licensee's confidential\
information (as provided in Section 1.7.1.2 above), which may\
be provided to NVIDIA in connection with Feedback by Licensee.\
Accordingly, Licensee agrees that nothing in this Agreement\
will be construed as a representation or inference that NVIDIA\
will not develop, design, manufacture, acquire, market\
products, or have products developed, designed, manufactured,\
acquired, or marketed for NVIDIA, that compete with the\
Licensee's products or confidential information.\
\
\
1.7.3. No Implied Licenses\
\
Under no circumstances should anything in this Agreement be\
construed as NVIDIA granting by implication, estoppel or\
otherwise, (i) a license to any NVIDIA product or technology\
other than the SOFTWARE; or (ii) any additional license rights\
for the SOFTWARE other than the licenses expressly granted in\

cannot be fully enforced under, the law, such provision will\
be construed as limited to the extent necessary to be\
consistent with and fully enforceable under the law. This\
Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement\
between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and\

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0\
\
    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE\
    PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\
    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\
\
1. DEFINITIONS\
\
"Contribution" means:\
\
  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\
     Distributed under this Agreement, and\
\
  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\
     i) changes to the Program, and\
     ii) additions to the Program;\
  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\
  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\
  "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\
  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\
  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that\
  are not Modified Works.\
\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\
\
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\
or when combined with the Program.\
\
"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\
Agreement.\
\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\
or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\
\
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\
\
"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\
results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\
contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\
in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified\
Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,\
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely\
in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program\
or Modified Works thereof.\
\
"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available\
in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\
\
"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making\
modifications, including but not limited to software source code,\
documentation source, and configuration files.\
\
"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,\
Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any\
exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial\
Contributor.\
\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\
\
  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\
  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\
  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\
  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\
\
  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\
  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\
  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\
  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\
  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\
  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\
  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\
  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\
  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\
  licensed hereunder.\
\
  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\
  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\
  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\
  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\
  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\
  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\
  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\
  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\
  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\
  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\
  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\
  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\
  before distributing the Program.\
\
  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\
  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\
  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\
\
  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\
  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\
  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\
  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\
  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\
\
3. REQUIREMENTS\
\
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\
\
  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\
  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\
\
  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\
  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\
  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\
  used for software exchange; and\
\
  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\
  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\
     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\
     for a particular purpose;\
\
     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\
\
     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\
     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\
\
     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\
     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\
     of this section 3.\
\
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\
\
  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\
  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\
  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\
  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\
  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\
  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\
\
  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\
  the Program.\
\
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\
of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of\
the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\
their own appropriate notices.\
\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\
\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\
the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\
offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\
the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\
("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\
other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,\
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits\
and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\
in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\
apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\
and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\
participate in any such claim at its own expense.\
\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\
claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\
pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\
those damages.\
\
5. NO WARRANTY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"\
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\
\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
7. GENERAL\
\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\
\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\
or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\
litigation is filed.\
\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\
\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\
Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\
Contributions) under the new version.\
\
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\
\
Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\
\
"This Source Code may also be made available under the following \
Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth \
in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: \{name license(s),\
version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here\}."\
\
  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\
  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\
\
  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\
  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\
  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\
  look for such a notice.\
\
  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation\
      source, and configuration files.\
\
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\
      and conversions to other media types.\
\
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\
\
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\
\
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\
\
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\
\
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\
\
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\
      meet the following conditions:\
\
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\
\
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\
          stating that You changed the files; and\
\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\
          the Derivative Works; and\
\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\
          as modifying the License.\
\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\
      the conditions stated in this License.\
\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\
\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\
\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\
\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\
\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\

\
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\
\
                            Preamble\
\
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\
software and other kinds of works.\
\
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\
your programs, too.\
\
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\
\
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\
\
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\
know their rights.\
\
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\
\
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\
authors of previous versions.\
\
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\
\
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\
\
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\
\
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\
modification follow.\
\
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\
\
  0. Definitions.\
\
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\
\
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\
works, such as semiconductor masks.\
\
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and\
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.\
\
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the\
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.\
\
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\
on the Program.\
\
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without\
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\
public, and in some countries other activities as well.\
\
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\
\
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"\
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\
\
  1. Source Code.\
\
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work\
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source\
form of a work.\
\
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official\
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\
is widely used among developers working in that language.\
\
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other\
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component\
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\
\
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all\
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\
includes interface definition files associated with source files for\
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\
subprograms and other parts of the work.\
\
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\
Source.\
\
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\
same work.\
\
  2. Basic Permissions.\
\
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\
\
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\
\
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\
makes it unnecessary.\
\
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\
\
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\
measures.\
\
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\
technological measures.\
\
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\
\
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\
\
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\
\
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\
\
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\
\
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\
    it, and giving a relevant date.\
\
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\
    released under this License and any conditions added under section\
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\
    "keep intact all notices".\
\
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\
\
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\
    work need not make them do so.\
\
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\
parts of the aggregate.\
\
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\
\
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\
in one of these ways:\
\
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\
    customarily used for software interchange.\
\
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\
\
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\
    with subsection 6b.\
\
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\
\
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\
    charge under subsection 6d.\
\
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\
included in conveying the object code work.\
\
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any\
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a\
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\
the only significant mode of use of the product.\
\
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,\
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\
modification has been made.\
\
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\
been installed in ROM).\
\
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\
protocols for communication across the network.\
\
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\
source code form), and must require no special password or key for\
unpacking, reading or copying.\
\
  7. Additional Terms.\
\
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this\
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\
this License without regard to the additional permissions.\
\
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\
\
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\
\
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\
\
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\
\
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\
\
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\
    authors of the material; or\
\
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\
\
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\
    those licensors and authors.\
\
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further\
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\
governed by this License along with a term that is a further\
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\
not survive such relicensing or conveying.\
\
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\
where to find the applicable terms.\
\
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\
the above requirements apply either way.\
\
  8. Termination.\
\
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\
paragraph of section 11).\
\
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\
prior to 60 days after the cessation.\
\
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\
your receipt of the notice.\
\
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\
material under section 10.\
\
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\
\
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\
\
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\
\
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\
\
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an\
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\
\
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\
\
  11. Patents.\
\
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".\
\
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims\
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant\
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\
this License.\
\
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\
propagate the contents of its contributor version.\
\
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express\
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a\
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\
patent against the party.\
\
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have\
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\
country that you have reason to believe are valid.\
\
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\
work and works based on it.\
\
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within\
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\
\
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\
\
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\
\
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\
\
\
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\
\
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\
combination as such.\
\
  14. Revised Versions of this License.\
\
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\
address new problems or concerns.\
\
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the\
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\
version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\
by the Free Software Foundation.\
\
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\
to choose that version for the Program.\
\
  Later license versions may give you additional or different\
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\
later version.\
\
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\
\
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\
\
  16. Limitation of Liability.\
\
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\
SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\
\
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\
copy of the Program in return for a fee.\

\
Eclipse Public License - v 2.0\
\
    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE\
    PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\
    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\
\
1. DEFINITIONS\
\
"Contribution" means:\
\
  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\
     Distributed under this Agreement, and\
\
  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\
     i) changes to the Program, and\
     ii) additions to the Program;\
  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\
  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\
  "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\
  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\
  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that\
  are not Modified Works.\
\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\
\
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\
or when combined with the Program.\
\
"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\
Agreement.\
\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\
or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\
\
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\
\
"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\
results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\
contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\
in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified\
Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,\
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely\
in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program\
or Modified Works thereof.\
\
"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available\
in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\
\
"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making\
modifications, including but not limited to software source code,\
documentation source, and configuration files.\
\
"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,\
Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any\
exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial\
Contributor.\
\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\
\
  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\
  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\
  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\
  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\
\
  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\
  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\
  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\
  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\
  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\
  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\
  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\
  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\
  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\
  licensed hereunder.\
\
  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\
  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\
  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\
  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\
  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\
  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\
  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\
  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\
  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\
  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\
  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\
  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\
  before distributing the Program.\
\
  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\
  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\
  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\
\
  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\
  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\
  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\
  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\
  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\
\
3. REQUIREMENTS\
\
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\
\
  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\
  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\
  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\
  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\
  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\
  used for software exchange; and\
\
  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\
  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\
     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\
     for a particular purpose;\
\
     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\
\
     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\
     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\
\
     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\
     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\
     of this section 3.\
\
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\
\
  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\
  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\
  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\
  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\
  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\
  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\
\
  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\
  the Program.\
\
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\
of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of\
the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\
their own appropriate notices.\
\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\
\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\
the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\
offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\
the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\
("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\
other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,\
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits\
and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\
in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\
apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\
and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\
participate in any such claim at its own expense.\
\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\
claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\
pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\
those damages.\
\
5. NO WARRANTY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"\
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\
\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
7. GENERAL\
\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\
\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\
or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\
litigation is filed.\
\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\
\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\
Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\
Contributions) under the new version.\
\
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\

\
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\
      and conversions to other media types.\
\
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\
\
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\
\
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\
\
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\
\
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\
      meet the following conditions:\
\
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\
\
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\
          stating that You changed the files; and\
\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\
          the Derivative Works; and\
\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\
\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\
          as modifying the License.\
\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\
      the conditions stated in this License.\
\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\
\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\
\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\
\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\
\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\
      meet the following conditions:\
\
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\
\
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\
          stating that You changed the files; and\
\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\
          the Derivative Works; and\
\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\
          as modifying the License.\
\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\
      the conditions stated in this License.\
\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\
\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\
\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\
\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\
\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\

JUnit v4.7\
\
Eclipse Public License -v 1.0\
\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\
\
1. DEFINITIONS\
\
"Contribution" means:\
\
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\
\
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\
\
i) changes to the Program, and\
\
ii) additions to the Program;\
\
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\
\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\
\
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\
\
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\
\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\
\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\
\
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\
\
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\
\
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\
\
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\
\
3. REQUIREMENTS\
\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\
\
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\
\
b) its license agreement:\
\
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\
\
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\
\
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\
\
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\
\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\
\
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\
\
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\
\
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\
\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\
\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\
\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\
\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\
\
5. NO WARRANTY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\
\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
7. GENERAL\
\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\
\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\
\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\
Version 2.1, February 1999\
\
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\
\
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,\
hence the version number 2.1.]\
\
Preamble\
\
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public \
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\
\
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about \
whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the \
explanations below.\
\
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure\
that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source \
code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are \
informed that you can do these things.\
\
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender \
these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify\
it.\
\
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that \
we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must\
provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library \
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\
\
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\
\
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is \
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the \
original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\
\
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot \
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that \
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\
\
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser \
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\
\
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking\
a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if \
the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code\
with the library.\
\
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These \
disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\
\
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it \
becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free\
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to \
free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\
\
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU \
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that \
is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\
\
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter\
must be combined with the library in order to run.\
\
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\
\
0.  This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\
 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this\
 License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".\
\
 A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\
\
 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the\
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a \
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,\
 translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)\
\
 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code \
 means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\
 control compilation and installation of the library.\
\
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a \
 work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the \
 Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\
\
1.  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all\
 the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the \
 Library.\
\
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange \
 for a fee.\
\
2.  You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and \
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\
\
     a)  The modified work must itself be a software library.\
     b)  You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\
     c)  You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\
     d)  If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that\
uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure \
that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the  facility still operates, and performs whatever part of \
its purpose remains meaningful.\
\
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the \
application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\
\
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that  work are not derived from the Library, \
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work \
based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend\
to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\
\
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent\
is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\
\
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a \
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\
\
3.  You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.\
To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License,\
version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared,\
then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\
\
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to \
all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\
\
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\
\
4.  You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form \
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, \
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\
\
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy \
the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not \
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\
\
5.  A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled \
or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and \
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\
\
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because\
it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License\
. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\
\
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may \
be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can\
be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\
\
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline \
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a \
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\
\
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\
\
6.  As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit \
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\
\
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are \
covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must \
include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, \
you must do one of these things:\
\
a)  Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were \
used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library,\
with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the \
Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes\
the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified \
definitions.)\
b)  Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a \
copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) \
will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is \
interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\
c)  Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in \
Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\
d)  If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\
specified materials from the same place.\
e)  Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\
\
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for \
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system\
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\
\
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally \
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\
distribute.\
\
7.  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other \
library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the \
work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\
\
a)  Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. \
This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\
b)  Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where\
to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\
\
8.  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any \
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your \
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their \
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\
\
9.  You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify\
or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,\
by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, \
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\
\
10.  Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from \
the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose \
any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\
third parties with this License.\
\
11.  If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent \
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations\
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, \
if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly \
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the \
Library.\
\
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is \
intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\
\
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of\
any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is \
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed \
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is \
willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\
\
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\
\
12.  If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\
the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation \
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License\
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\
\
13.  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. \
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\
\
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it\
and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version \
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever \
published by the Free Software Foundation.\
\
14.  If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with \
these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free \
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\

\
15.  BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF \
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A \
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE,\
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\
\
16.  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY \
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR \
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING \
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN\
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\
\
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\
\
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software\
that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the\
terms of the ordinary General Public License).\
\
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to \
most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the \
full notice is found.\
\
one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\
Copyright (C) year  name of author\
This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as \
published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\
\
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of \
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.\
\
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\
\
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\
\
\
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the \
library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\
\
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random\
Hacker.\
\
signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990\
Ty Coon, President of Vice\
\
That's all there is to it!\

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\
\
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\
\
\
  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates\
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public\
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\
\
  0. Additional Definitions.\
\
  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU\
General Public License.\
\
  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\
\
  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\
of using an interface provided by the Library.\
\
  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an\
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked\
Version".\
\
  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the\
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\
\
  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the\
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\
\
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\
\
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\
\
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\
\
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\
version:\
\
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\
\
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\
   this License applicable to that copy.\
\
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\
\
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\
\
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\
   covered by this License.\
\
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\
   document.\
\
  4. Combined Works.\
\
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\
the following:\
\
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\
   covered by this License.\
\
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\
   document.\
\
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\
\
   d) Do one of the following:\
\
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\
       Corresponding Source.\
\
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\
       Version.\
\
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\
\
  5. Combined Libraries.\
\
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\
Library side by side in a single library together with other library\
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\
choice, if you do both of the following:\
\
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\
   conveyed under the terms of this License.\
\
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\
\
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\
\
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\
\
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"\
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\
conditions either of that published version or of any later version\
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\
\
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\
Library.\

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation\
      source, and configuration files.\
\
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\
      and conversions to other media types.\
\
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\
\
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\
\
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\
\
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\
\
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\
\
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\
      meet the following conditions:\
\
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\
\
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\
          stating that You changed the files; and\
\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\
          the Derivative Works; and\
\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\
          as modifying the License.\
\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\
      the conditions stated in this License.\
\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\
\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\
\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\
\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\
\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\

Dynamic Drive DHTML scripts - Terms of Use\
\
Unless indicated otherwise by the credit, all scripts on this site are original scripts written by the authors of Dynamic Drive, and\
are protected by both US and international copyright laws. The below lists the terms of use users of Dynamic Drive must agree to \
before using the programs/scripts (Last updated: May 22nd, 06):\
Users may use any DHTML scripts offered for download on Dynamic Drive, free of charge, on both personal and commercial web sites. \
This includes web designers who wish to use our DHTML scripts in their paid web site projects.\
\
You may modify our scripts to customize them based on your needs.\
\
Users may NOT, however, redistribute or repost/ resell for download any DHTML script found on Dynamic Drive. Redistribution is \
defined as re-offering our scripts for download in any fashion, whether on a competing web site, an application that generates code \
snippets, or a CD-ROM collection of CSS/JavaScript codes etc. Some examples of what is acceptable and what is not are:\
Acceptable:\
-Use our DHTML scripts on any personal or commercial web site to aid in its functionality/ usability.\
-As a web designer, use our DHTML scripts in your paid projects for your client web sites.\
-As a software developer, use our DHTML scripts within a application/ program as part of its interface, such as a CSS menu being used\
 as the program's navigation interface. The program itself can be distributable.\
\
In all cases above, the credit notice within the script must remain intact and unaltered.\
Not Acceptable:\
-Put our DHTML scripts on another script library or webmaster type site for others to download.\
-Use our DHTML scripts in any type of service or application whereby our codes are part of the product offerings themselves.\
-Put our DHTML scripts in any other types of medium for direct redistribution, such as a CD-ROM that consists of, but not limited to,\
 webmaster codes and web graphics.\
\
Users agree not to remove/ edit the credit notice within the DHTML source code, or claim the code to be work of their own. What is \
the copyright notice? It appears inside the <script> tag of each script, and looks something like this:\
/***********************************************\
* Dynamic Countdown script- (c) Dynamic Drive (http://www.dynamicdrive.com)\
* This notice MUST stay intact for legal use\
* Visit http://www.dynamicdrive.com/ for this script and 100s more.\
***********************************************/\
Sometimes you may wish to move the DHTML script to an external .js file. In such instances, the credit notice must still be retained\
within the SCRIPT tags, in the page's visible source:\
<script src="countdown.js" type="text/javascript">\
/***********************************************\
* Dynamic Countdown script- (c) Dynamic Drive (http://www.dynamicdrive.com)\
* This notice MUST stay intact for legal use\
* Visit http://www.dynamicdrive.com/ for this script and 100s more.\
***********************************************/\
</script>\
Users agree not to use scripts found on Dynamic Drive for illegal purposes, or on pages containing illegal material.\
\
Users agree not to hold Dynamic Drive liable for any damages resulted from proper or improper use of any of the scripts found on \
Dynamic Drive. Use at your own risk.\
\
Users are not required to link back to Dynamic Drive to use our DHTML scripts, as much as they are appreciated. :)\
By using any of the scripts on Dynamic Drive, you understand that you have read and agreed to the above usage terms. These terms will\
be strictly enforced, and violators will face criminal charges. Don't say our lawyer didn't warn you!\

     Works; and\
\
     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its \
     distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must \

     documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, \
     within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and \
     wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents \
     of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not \
     modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices \
     within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an \
     addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such \

whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless \
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent \
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You \
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or \
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this \
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but \
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer \

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own \
behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other \

The following will be added to the notices file for Shrinksafe (and called out \
in the DOU for Dojo):\
\
\
The Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 covers the optional Shrinksafe build \
tool, and Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2 which is redistributed with that tool.  Shrinksafe \
contains modified files from Mozilla Rhino covered under Mozilla Public License \
Version 1.1.  The source code for these modifications has been made available at \
the public Dojo svn repository at http://www.dojotoolkit.org.  \
\
The Shrinksafe tool requires use of Mozilla Rhino 1.6r7 or higher in order to \
run.  We are relying on the separate DD Checklist already approved for the Rhino \
1.7R2 jar. The version of Rhino that will be redistributed with the Shrinksafe \
package by default is the approved version of Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2.\

3. Time Zone Database\
ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.\
7.  Database Ownership\
\
   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\
   document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\
   that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public\
   domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply\
   to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.\
   Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,\
   the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in\
   this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,\
   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court\
   orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust\
   on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the\
   database or code waives all rights to future claims in that\
   contribution or in the TZ Database.\

____________________________________\
\
This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use".\
Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common questions about using materials from our site, including specific terms and conditions for packages like libwww, Amaya, and Jigsaw. Other questions about this notice can be directed to site-policy@w3.org.\

\
In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or redistribute SAX, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use SAX (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the SAX to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\

A copy of this License must be included in any documentation for such Subject Software where the recipients' rights relating to Subject Software are described. Recipient may distribute the source code version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that (i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the license terms include this Section 2 and Sections 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other terms of such license. If Recipient distributes the source code version under a different license Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, not by SGI. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result of any such terms Recipient offers.\
\
3. Redistribution in Executable Form. The notice set forth in Exhibit A must be conspicuously included in any notice in an executable version of Subject Software, related documentation or collateral in which Recipient describes the user's rights relating to the Subject Software. Recipient may distribute the executable version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that (i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other terms of such license.

\
4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if Recipient fails to comply with terms herein and fails to cure such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject Software which is properly granted shall survive any termination of this License absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\
\
5. No Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever. No trade name, trademark or service mark of SGI may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Subject Software without prior written permission of SGI.\

Title to and ownership of the Original Software at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Original Software not expressly granted under this License are reserved.\

\
8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any one or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribution, import or sale of Subject Software (including particular functionality or code incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the third party's intellectual property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page bearing the title "LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description of the party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the Subject Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim.

If Recipient obtains such knowledge after it makes Subject Software available to any other person or entity, Recipient shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Subject Software that new knowledge has been obtained.\

3. Distribution Obligations.\
\
     3.1. Application of License.\
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\
\
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\
\
     3.3. Description of Modifications.\
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\
\
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\
          (a) Third Party Claims.\
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\
\
          (b) Contributor APIs.\
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\
\
          (c)    Representations.\
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\
\
     3.5. Required Notices.\
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\
\
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\
\
     3.7. Larger Works.\
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\
\
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\
\
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\
\
5. Application of this License.\
\
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\
\
6. Versions of the License.\
\
     6.1. New Versions.\
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\
\
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\
\
     6.3. Derivative Works.\
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\
\
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\
\
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\
\
8. TERMINATION.\
\
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\
\
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:\
\
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\
\
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\
\
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\
\
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\
\
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\
\
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\
\
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\
\
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\
\
11. MISCELLANEOUS.\
\
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\
\
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\
\
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\
\
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\
\
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\
\

ABSTRACT\
========\
\
   UPX and UCL are copyrighted software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (hereinafter the "GPL").\
\
   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The\
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\
\
   As a special exception we grant the free usage of UPX for all executables, including commercial programs. See below for details and restrictions.\

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\
==========================\
\
   UPX and the UCL library are free software; you can redistribute them and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU General Public License as\
   published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\

\
\
SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR COMPRESSED EXECUTABLES\
============================================\
\
   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part  of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\
\
   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\
\
   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option) with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\
      distributed by us.\
   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e. the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\
   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied, called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\
\
\
ANNOTATIONS\
===========\
\
  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\
\
  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as, but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\
    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\
\
  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\
    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -  any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious by definition.\
\
  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.\
\
  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.\

\
\
1. NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit License Agreement\
----------------------------------------\
\
\
Important Notice\
----------------\
\
READ CAREFULLY: This Software License Agreement ("Agreement")\
for NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, including computer software and\
associated documentation ("Software"), is the Agreement which\
governs use of the SOFTWARE of NVIDIA Corporation and its\
subsidiaries ("NVIDIA") downloadable herefrom. By downloading,\
installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, You (as\
defined below) agree to be bound by the terms of this\
Agreement. If You do not agree to the terms of this Agreement,\
do not download the SOFTWARE.\
\
\
Recitals\
--------\
\
Use of NVIDIA's SOFTWARE requires three elements: the\
SOFTWARE, an NVIDIA GPU or application processor ("NVIDIA\
Hardware"), and a computer system. The SOFTWARE is protected\
by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as\
well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The\
SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only licensed for Your\
use, strictly in accordance with this Agreement. The NVIDIA\
Hardware is protected by various patents, and is sold, but\
this Agreement does not cover the sale or use of such\
hardware, since it may not necessarily be sold as a package\
with the SOFTWARE. This Agreement sets forth the terms and\
conditions of the SOFTWARE only.\
\
\
1.1. Definitions\
\
\
1.1.1. Licensee\
\
"You", or "Your" shall mean the entity or individual that\
downloads and uses the SOFTWARE.\
\
\
1.1.2. Redistributable Software\
\
"Redistributable Software" shall mean the redistributable\
libraries referenced in Attachment A of this Agreement.\
\
\
1.1.3. Software\
\
"SOFTWARE" shall mean the deliverables provided pursuant to\
this Agreement.\
\
\
1.2. Grant of License\
\
\
1.2.1. Rights and Limitations of Grant\
\
Provided that Licensee complies with the terms of this\
Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants Licensee the following\
limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable\
(except as expressly permitted otherwise for Redistributable\
Software in Section 1.2.1.1 and Section 1.2.1.3 of this\
Agreement) right to use the SOFTWARE, with the following\
limitations:\
\
\
1.2.1.1. Redistribution Rights\
\
Licensee may transfer, redistribute, and sublicense certain\
files of the Redistributable SOFTWARE, as defined in\
Attachment A of this Agreement, provided, however, that (a)\
the Redistributable SOFTWARE shall be distributed solely in\
binary form to Licensee's licensees ("Customers") only as a\
component of Licensee's own software products (each, a\
"Licensee Application"); (b) Licensee shall design the\
Licensee Application such that the Redistributable SOFTWARE\
files are installed only in a private (non-shared) directory\
location that is used only by the Licensee Application; (c)\
Licensee shall obtain each Customer's written or clickwrap\
agreement to the license terms under a written, legally\
enforceable agreement that has the effect of protecting the\
SOFTWARE and the rights of NVIDIA under terms no less\
restrictive than this Agreement.\
\
\
1.2.1.2. Usage Rights\
\
Licensee may install and use multiple copies of the SOFTWARE\
on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers,\
and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for\
Licensee's use within Licensee's Enterprise. "Enterprise"\
shall mean individual use by Licensee or any legal entity\
(such as a corporation or university) and the subsidiaries it\
owns by more than 50 percent.\
\
\
1.2.1.3. Further Redistribution Rights\
\
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Licensee\
may authorize Customers to further redistribute the\
Redistributable SOFTWARE that such Customers receive as part\
of the Licensee Application, solely in binary form, provided,\
however, that Licensee shall require in their standard\
software license agreements with Customers that all such\
redistributions must be made pursuant to a license agreement\
that has the effect of protecting the SOFTWARE and the rights\
of NVIDIA whose terms and conditions are at least as\
restrictive as those in the applicable Licensee software\
license agreement covering the Licensee Application. For\
avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement shall not\
affect rights previously granted by Licensee to its Customers\
under this Agreement to the extent validly granted to\
Customers under Section 1.2.1.1.\
\
\
1.2.1.4. Linux/FreeBSD Exception\
\
Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Section 1.2.1.2,\
Section 1.2.1.1 and Section 1.2.1.3, SOFTWARE designed\
exclusively for use on the Linux or FreeBSD operating systems,\
or other operating systems derived from the source code to\
these operating systems, may be copied and redistributed,\
provided that the binary files thereof are not modified in any\
way (except for unzipping of compressed files).\
\
\
1.2.1.5. Additional Licensing Obligations\
\
Licensee acknowledges and agrees that its use of certain third\
party components included with the SOFTWARE may be subject to\
additional licensing terms and conditions as set forth or\
referenced in Attachment B of this Agreement.\
\
\
1.2.1.6. Limitations\
\
No Reverse Engineering\
\
Licensee may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble\
the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other manner to obtain the\
source code.\
\
No Separation of Components\
\
The SOFTWARE is licensed as a single product. Except as\
authorized in this Agreement, Software component parts of the\
Software may not be separated for use on more than one\
computer, nor otherwise used separately from the other parts.\
\
No Rental\
\
Licensee may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone else.\
\
\
1.3. Term and Termination\
\
This Agreement will continue in effect for two (2) years\
("Initial Term") after Your initial download and use of the\
SOFTWARE, subject to the exclusive right of NVIDIA to\
terminate as provided herein. The term of this Agreement will\
automatically renew for successive one (1) year renewal terms\
after the Initial Term, unless either party provides to the\
other party at least three (3) months prior written notice of\
termination before the end of the applicable renewal term.\
\
This Agreement will automatically terminate if Licensee fails\
to comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof. In such\
event, Licensee must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and\
all of its component parts.\
\
\
Defensive Suspension\
\
If Licensee commences or participates in any legal proceeding\
against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion,\
suspend or terminate all license grants and any other rights\
provided under this Agreement during the pendency of such\
legal proceedings.\
\
\
1.4. Copyright\
\
All rights, title, interest and copyrights in and to the\
SOFTWARE (including but not limited to all images,\
photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and other\
information incorporated into the SOFTWARE), the accompanying\
printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE, are owned\
by NVIDIA, or its suppliers. The SOFTWARE is protected by\
copyright laws and international treaty provisions.\
Accordingly, Licensee is required to treat the SOFTWARE like\
any other copyrighted material, except as otherwise allowed\
pursuant to this Agreement and that it may make one copy of\
the SOFTWARE solely for backup or archive purposes.\
\
RESTRICTED RIGHTS NOTICE. Software has been developed entirely\
at private expense and is commercial computer software\
provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS. Use, duplication or\
disclosure by the U.S. Government or a U.S. Government\
subcontractor is subject to the restrictions set forth in the\
Agreement under which Software was obtained pursuant to DFARS\
227.7202-3(a) or as set forth in subparagraphs (c)(1) and (2)\
of the Commercial Computer Software - Restricted Rights clause\
at FAR 52.227-19, as applicable. Contractor/manufacturer is\
NVIDIA, 2701 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95050.\
\
\
1.5. Applicable Law\
\
This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall\
be construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of Delaware.\
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\
International Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed. The\
courts of Santa Clara County, California shall have exclusive\
jurisdiction and venue over any dispute arising out of or\
relating to this Agreement.\
\
\
1.6. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitations on Liability\
\
\
1.6.1. No Warranties\
\
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE\
SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND NVIDIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS\

1.7. Miscellaneous\
\
\
1.7.1. Feedback\
\
Notwithstanding any Non-Disclosure Agreement executed by and\
between the parties, the parties agree that in the event\
Licensee or NVIDIA provides Feedback (as defined below) to the\
other party on how to design, implement, or improve the\
SOFTWARE or Licensee's product(s) for use with the SOFTWARE,\
the following terms and conditions apply the Feedback:\
\
\
1.7.1.1. Exchange of Feedback\
\
Both parties agree that neither party has an obligation to\
give the other party any suggestions, comments or other\
feedback, whether verbally or in written or source code form,\
relating to (i) the SOFTWARE; (ii) Licensee's products; (iii)\
Licensee's use of the SOFTWARE; or (iv)\
optimization/interoperability of Licensee's product with the\
SOFTWARE (collectively defined as "Feedback"). In the event\
either party provides Feedback to the other party, the party\
receiving the Feedback may use any Feedback that the other\
party voluntarily provides to improve the (i) SOFTWARE or\
other related NVIDIA technologies, respectively for the\
benefit of NVIDIA; or (ii) Licensee's product or other related\
Licensee technologies, respectively for the benefit of\
Licensee. Accordingly, if either party provides Feedback to\
the other party, both parties agree that the other party and\
its respective licensees may freely use, reproduce, license,\
distribute, and otherwise commercialize the Feedback in the\
(i) SOFTWARE or other related technologies; or (ii) Licensee's\
products or other related technologies, respectively, without\
the payment of any royalties or fees.\
\
\
\
1.7.1.2. Residual Rights\
\
Licensee agrees that NVIDIA shall be free to use any general\
knowledge, skills and experience, (including, but not limited\
to, ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques) ("Residuals"),\
contained in the (i) Feedback provided by Licensee to NVIDIA;\
(ii) Licensee's products shared or disclosed to NVIDIA in\
connection with the Feedback; or (c) Licensee's confidential\
information voluntarily provided to NVIDIA in connection with\
the Feedback, which are retained in the memories of NVIDIA's\
employees, agents, or contractors who have had access to such\
Residuals. Subject to the terms and conditions of this\
Agreement, NVIDIA's employees, agents, or contractors shall\
not be prevented from using Residuals as part of such\
employee's, agent's or contractor's general knowledge, skills,\
experience, talent, and/or expertise. NVIDIA shall not have\
any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such\
employees, agents or contractors or to pay royalties for any\
work resulting from the use of Residuals.\
\
\
1.7.1.3. Disclaimer of Warranty\
\
FEEDBACK FROM EITHER PARTY IS PROVIDED FOR THE OTHER PARTY'S\
USE "AS IS" AND BOTH PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS,\
IMPLIED AND STATUTORY INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE\
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A\
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. BOTH PARTIES DO NOT\
REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE FEEDBACK WILL MEET THE OTHER\
PARTY'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OR IMPLEMENTATION\
OF THE FEEDBACK WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.\
\
\
1.7.1.4. No Liability for Consequential Damages\
\
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT\
SHALL EITHER PARTY OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,\
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER\
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS\
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION,\
OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR\
INABILITY TO USE THE FEEDBACK, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS\
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
\
1.7.2. Freedom of Action\
\
Licensee agrees that this Agreement is nonexclusive and NVIDIA\
may currently or in the future be developing software, other\
technology or confidential information internally, or\
receiving confidential information from other parties that\
maybe similar to the Feedback and Licensee's confidential\
information (as provided in Section 1.7.1.2 above), which may\
be provided to NVIDIA in connection with Feedback by Licensee.\
Accordingly, Licensee agrees that nothing in this Agreement\
will be construed as a representation or inference that NVIDIA\
will not develop, design, manufacture, acquire, market\
products, or have products developed, designed, manufactured,\
acquired, or marketed for NVIDIA, that compete with the\
Licensee's products or confidential information.\
\
\
1.7.3. No Implied Licenses\
\
Under no circumstances should anything in this Agreement be\
construed as NVIDIA granting by implication, estoppel or\
otherwise, (i) a license to any NVIDIA product or technology\
other than the SOFTWARE; or (ii) any additional license rights\
for the SOFTWARE other than the licenses expressly granted in\
this Agreement.\
\
\
1.7.4. \
\
If any provision of this Agreement is inconsistent with, or\
cannot be fully enforced under, the law, such provision will\
be construed as limited to the extent necessary to be\
consistent with and fully enforceable under the law. This\
Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement\
between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and\
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings and\
agreements relating to such subject matter, whether oral or\
written. This Agreement may only be modified in writing signed\
by an authorized officer of NVIDIA. Licensee agrees that it\
will not ship, transfer or export the SOFTWARE into any\
country, or use the SOFTWARE in any manner, prohibited by the\
United States Bureau of Industry and Security or any export\
laws, restrictions or regulations.\
\
\
1.7.5. \
\
The parties agree that the following sections of the Agreement\
will survive the termination of the License: Section 1.2.1.4,\
Section 1.4, Section 1.5, Section 1.6, and Section 1.7.\

    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as\
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc" \
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The\
    basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also \
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-\
    in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are \
    both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.\

\
    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE\
    PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\
    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\
\
1. DEFINITIONS\
\
"Contribution" means:\
\
  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\
     Distributed under this Agreement, and\
\
  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\
     i) changes to the Program, and\
     ii) additions to the Program;\
  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\
  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\
  "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\
  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\
  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that\
  are not Modified Works.\
\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\
\
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\
or when combined with the Program.\
\
"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\
Agreement.\
\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\
or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\
\
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\
\
"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\
results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\
contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\
in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified\
Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,\
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely\
in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program\
or Modified Works thereof.\
\
"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available\
in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\
\
"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making\
modifications, including but not limited to software source code,\
documentation source, and configuration files.\
\
"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,\
Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any\
exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial\
Contributor.\
\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\
\
  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\
  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\
  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\
  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\
\
  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\
  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\
  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\
  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\
  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\
  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\
  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\
  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\
  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\
  licensed hereunder.\
\
  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\
  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\
  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\
  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\
  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\
  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\
  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\
  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\
  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\
  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\
  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\
  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\
  before distributing the Program.\
\
  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\
  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\
  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\
\
  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\
  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\
  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\
  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\
  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\
\
3. REQUIREMENTS\
\
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\
\
  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\
  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\
  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\
  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\
  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\
  used for software exchange; and\
\
  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\
  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\
     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\
     for a particular purpose;\
\
     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\
\
     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\
     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\
\
     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\
     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\
     of this section 3.\
\
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\
\
  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\
  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\
  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\
  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\
  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\
  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\
\
  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\
  the Program.\
\
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\
of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of\
the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\
their own appropriate notices.\
\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\
\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\
the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\
offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\
the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\
("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\
other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,\
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits\
and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\
in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\
apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\
and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\
participate in any such claim at its own expense.\
\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\
claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\
pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\
those damages.\
\
5. NO WARRANTY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"\
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\
\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
7. GENERAL\
\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\
\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\
or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\
litigation is filed.\
\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\
\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\
Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\
Contributions) under the new version.\
\
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\

      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\
\
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\
\
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\
\
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\
\
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\
      meet the following conditions:\
\
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\
\
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\
          stating that You changed the files; and\
\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\
          the Derivative Works; and\
\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\
          as modifying the License.\
\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\
      the conditions stated in this License.\
\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\
\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\
\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\
\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\
\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\
\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\
\
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\
\
                            Preamble\
\
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\
software and other kinds of works.\
\
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\
your programs, too.\
\
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\
\
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\
\
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\
know their rights.\
\
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\
\
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\
authors of previous versions.\
\
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\
\
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\
\
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\
modification follow.\
\
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\
\
  0. Definitions.\
\
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\
\
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\
works, such as semiconductor masks.\
\
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and\
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.\
\
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the\
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.\
\
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\
on the Program.\
\
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without\
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\
public, and in some countries other activities as well.\
\
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\
\
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"\
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\
\
  1. Source Code.\
\
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work\
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source\
form of a work.\
\
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official\
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\
is widely used among developers working in that language.\
\
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other\
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component\
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\
\
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all\
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\
includes interface definition files associated with source files for\
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\
subprograms and other parts of the work.\
\
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\
Source.\
\
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\
same work.\
\
  2. Basic Permissions.\
\
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\
\
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\
\
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\
makes it unnecessary.\
\
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\
\
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\
measures.\
\
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\
technological measures.\
\
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\
\
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\
\
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\
\
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\
\
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\
\
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\
    it, and giving a relevant date.\
\
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\
    released under this License and any conditions added under section\
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\
    "keep intact all notices".\
\
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\
\
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\
    work need not make them do so.\
\
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\
parts of the aggregate.\
\
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\
\
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\
in one of these ways:\
\
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\
    customarily used for software interchange.\
\
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\
\
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\
    with subsection 6b.\
\
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\
\
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\
    charge under subsection 6d.\
\
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\
included in conveying the object code work.\
\
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any\
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a\
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\
the only significant mode of use of the product.\
\
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,\
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\
modification has been made.\
\
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\
been installed in ROM).\
\
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\
protocols for communication across the network.\
\
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\
source code form), and must require no special password or key for\
unpacking, reading or copying.\
\
  7. Additional Terms.\
\
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this\
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\
this License without regard to the additional permissions.\
\
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\
\
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\
\
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\
\
\
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\
\
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\
\
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\
    authors of the material; or\
\
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\
\
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\
    those licensors and authors.\
\
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further\
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\
governed by this License along with a term that is a further\
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\
not survive such relicensing or conveying.\
\
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\
where to find the applicable terms.\
\
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\
the above requirements apply either way.\
\
  8. Termination.\
\
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\
paragraph of section 11).\
\
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\
prior to 60 days after the cessation.\
\
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\
your receipt of the notice.\
\
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\
material under section 10.\
\
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\
\
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\
\
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\
\
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\
\
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an\
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\
\
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\
\
  11. Patents.\
\
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".\
\
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims\
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant\
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\
this License.\
\
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\
propagate the contents of its contributor version.\
\
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express\
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a\
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\
patent against the party.\
\
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have\
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\
country that you have reason to believe are valid.\
\
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\
work and works based on it.\
\
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within\
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\
\
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\
\
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\
\
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\
\
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\
\
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\
combination as such.\
\
  14. Revised Versions of this License.\
\
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\
address new problems or concerns.\
\
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the\
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\
version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\
by the Free Software Foundation.\
\
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\
to choose that version for the Program.\
\
  Later license versions may give you additional or different\
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\
later version.\
\
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\
\
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\
\
  16. Limitation of Liability.\
\
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\
SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\
\
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\
copy of the Program in return for a fee.\

\
Eclipse Public License - v 2.0\
\
    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE\
    PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\
    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\
\
1. DEFINITIONS\
\
"Contribution" means:\
\
  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\
     Distributed under this Agreement, and\
\
  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\
     i) changes to the Program, and\
     ii) additions to the Program;\
  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\
  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\
  "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\
  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\
  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that\
  are not Modified Works.\
\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\
\
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\
or when combined with the Program.\
\
"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\
Agreement.\
\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\
or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\
\
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\
\
"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\
results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\
contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\
in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified\
Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,\
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely\
in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program\
or Modified Works thereof.\
\
"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available\
in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\
\
"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making\
modifications, including but not limited to software source code,\
documentation source, and configuration files.\
\
"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,\
Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any\
exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial\
Contributor.\
\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\
\
  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\
  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\
  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\
  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\
\
  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\
  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\
  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\
  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\
  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\
  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\
  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\
  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\
  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\
  licensed hereunder.\
\
  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\
  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\
  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\
  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\
  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\
  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\
  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\
  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\
  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\
  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\
  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\
  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\
  before distributing the Program.\
\
  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\
  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\
  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\
\
  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\
  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\
  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\
  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\
  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\
\
3. REQUIREMENTS\
\
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\
\
  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\
  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\
  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\
  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\
  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\
  used for software exchange; and\
\
  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\
  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\
     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\
     for a particular purpose;\
\
     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\
\
     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\
     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\
\
     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\
     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\
     of this section 3.\
\
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\
\
  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\
  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\
  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\
  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\
  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\
  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\
\
  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\
  the Program.\
\
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\
of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of\
the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\
their own appropriate notices.\
\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\
\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\
the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\
offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\
the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\
("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\
other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,\
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits\
and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\
in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\
apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\
and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\
participate in any such claim at its own expense.\
\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\
claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\
pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\
those damages.\
\
5. NO WARRANTY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"\
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\
\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\
\
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
7. GENERAL\
\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\
\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\
or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\
litigation is filed.\
\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\
\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\
Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\
Contributions) under the new version.\
\
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\
\
Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\
\
"This Source Code may also be made available under the following \
Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth \
in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: \{name license(s),\
version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here\}."\
\
  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\
  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\
\
  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\
  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\
  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\
  look for such a notice.\
\
  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\

\
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\

      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\
          the Derivative Works; and\
\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\

          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\

          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\
          as modifying the License.\
\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\
      the conditions stated in this License.\
\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\
\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\
\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\
\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\
\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\
Version 3, 29 June 2007\
Copyright (c) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\
\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\
document, but changing it is not allowed.\
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and\
conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the\
additional permissions listed below.\
\
0. Additional Definitions.\
As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General\
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public\
License.\
\
"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an\
Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\
\
An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the\
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of\
a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided\
by the Library.\
\
A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with\
the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work\
was made is also called the "Linked Version".\
\
The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding\
Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the\
Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and\
not on the Linked Version.\
\
The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code\
and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs\
needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the\
System Libraries of the Combined Work.\
\
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without\
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\
\
2. Conveying Modified Versions.\
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility\
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the\
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then\
you may convey a copy of the modified version:\
* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\
ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data,\
the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains\
meaningful, or\
* b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this\
License applicable to that copy.\
\
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header\
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of\
your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to\
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,\
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of\
the following:\
* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this\
License.\
* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\
document.\
\
4. Combined Works.\
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together,\
effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library\
contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such\
modifications, if you also do each of the following:\
* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the\
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this\
\
License.\
* b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\
document.\
* c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,\
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a\
reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license\
document.\
* d) Do one of the following:\
o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and\
under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a\
modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in\
the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding\
Source.\
o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\
Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the\
Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate\
properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible\
with the Linked Version.\
* e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be\
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to\
the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified\
version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\
Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option\
4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding\
Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must\
provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the\
GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\
\
5. Combined Libraries.\
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by\
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not\
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined\
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\
* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on\
the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the\
terms of this License.\
* b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a\
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying\
uncombined form of the same work.\
\
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU\
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address\
new problems or concerns.\
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you\
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General\
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of\
following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any\
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public\
License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License\
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether\
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that\
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization\
for you to choose that version for the Library.\

\
    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\
\
Preamble\
\
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\
\
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\
\
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\
\
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\
\
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\
\
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\
\
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\
\
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\
\
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\
\
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\
\
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\
\
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\
\
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\
\
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\
\
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\
\
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".\
\
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\
\
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)\
\
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\
\
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\
\
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\
\
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\
\
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\
\
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\
\
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\
\
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\
\
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\
\
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\
\
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\
\
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\
\
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. \
\
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\
\
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\
\
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\
\
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\
\
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\
\
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\
\
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\
\
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\
\
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\
\
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\
\
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\
\
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\
\
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\
\
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\
\
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\
\
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\
\
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\
\
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\
\
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\
\
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\
\
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\
\
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\
\
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\
\
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\
\
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\
\
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\
\
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\
\
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\
\
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\
\
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\
\
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\
\
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\
\
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\
\
NO WARRANTY\
\
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\
\
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
\
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\
\
\
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\
\
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\
\
    <one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\
\
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\
\
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.\
\
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA \
\
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\
\
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\
\
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\

\
- Minizip 1.1\
\
IBM obtained the right to use the software under the following license from MiniZip:\
\
MiniZip - Copyright (c) 1998-2010 - by Gilles Vollant - version 1.1 64 bits from Mathias Svensson\
\
Introduction\
---------------------\
MiniZip 1.1 is built from MiniZip 1.0 by Gilles Vollant ( http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html )\
\
When adding ZIP64 support into minizip it would result into risk of breaking compatibility with minizip 1.0.\
All possible work was done for compatibility.\
\
\
Background\
---------------------\
When adding ZIP64 support Mathias Svensson found that Even Rouault have added ZIP64 \
support for unzip.c into minizip for a open source project called gdal ( http://www.gdal.org/ )\
\
That was used as a starting point. And after that ZIP64 support was added to zip.c\
some refactoring and code cleanup was also done.\
\
\
Changed from MiniZip 1.0 to MiniZip 1.1\
---------------------------------------\
* Added ZIP64 support for unzip ( by Even Rouault )\
* Added ZIP64 support for zip ( by Mathias Svensson )\
* Reverted some changed that Even Rouault did.\
* Bunch of patches received from Gulles Vollant that he received for MiniZip from various users.\
* Added unzip patch for BZIP Compression method (patch create by Daniel Borca)\
* Added BZIP Compress method for zip\
* Did some refactoring and code cleanup\
\

\
   1.11. "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Covered Code for\
      making modifications to it, including all modules it contains,\
      plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to\
      control compilation and installation of an Executable, or source\
      code differential comparisons against either the Original Code or\
      another well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's\
      choice. The Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form,\

\
   2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.\
      The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\
      non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property\
      claims:\
\
      (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\
          trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,\
          modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original\
          Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications,\
          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\
\
      (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling\
          of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and\
          offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code\
          (or portions thereof).\
\
      (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are\
          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes\
          Original Code under the terms of this License.\
\
      (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is\
          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code;\
          2) separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements\
          caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the\
          combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.\
\
   2.2. Contributor Grant.\
\
      Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor\
      hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license\
\
      (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\
          trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,\
          display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications\
          created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on\
          an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code\
          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\
\
      (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling\
          of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or\
          in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such\
          combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,\
          and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that\
          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of\
          Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor\
          Version (or portions of such combination).\
\
      (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective\
          on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the\
          Covered Code.\
\
      (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is\
          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from\
          the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor\
          Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party\
          modifications of Contributor Version or ii)  the combination\
          of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software\
          (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices;\
          or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the\
          absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.\
\
3. Distribution Obligations.\
\
   3.1. Application of License.\
\
      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute\
      are governed by the terms of this License, including without\
      limitation Section 2.2.  The Source Code version of Covered Code\
      may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future\
      version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must\
      include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code\
      You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source\
      Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of\
      this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You\
      may include an additional document offering the additional rights\
      described in Section 3.5.\
\
   3.2. Availability of Source Code.\
\
      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must\
      be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this\
      License either on the same media as an Executable version or via\
      an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom\
      you made an Executable version available; and if made available\
      via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for\
      at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became\
      available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version\
      of that particular Modification has been made available to such\
      recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code\
      version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution\
      Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\
\
   3.3. Description of Modifications.\
\
      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain\
      a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered\
      Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent\
      statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,\
      from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including\
      the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b)\
      in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation\
      in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\
\
   3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\
\
      (a) Third Party Claims.\
\
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third\
          party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise\
          the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or\
          2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the\
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient\
          will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge\
          after the Modification is made available as described in Section\
          3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all\
          copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take\
          other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or\
          newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received\
          the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\
\
      (b) Contributor APIs.\
\
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application\
          programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent\
          licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that\
          API, Contributor must also include this information in the\
          LEGAL file.\
\
      (c)   Representations.\
\
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed\
          by this License.\
\
   3.5. Required Notices.\
\
      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the\
      Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a\
      particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must\
      include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)\
      where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You\
      created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a\
      Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also\
      duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code\
      where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating\
      to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\
      warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or\
      more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on\
      Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or\
      any Contributor.\
\
      You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,\
      indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and\
      You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer\
      or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity\
      or liability terms You offer.\
\
   3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\
\
      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\
      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version\
      of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\
      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\
      obligations of Section 3.2.  The notice must be conspicuously\
      included in any notice in an Executable version, related\
      documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'\
      rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the\
      Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a\
      license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from\
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms\
      of this License and that the license for the Executable version\
      does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the\
      Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.\
      If You distribute the Executable version under a different license\
      You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\
      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\
      Developer or any Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the\
      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\
      by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any\
      such terms You offer.\
\
   3.7. Larger Works.\
\
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\
      code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the\
      Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure\
      the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\
\
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\
\
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\
   License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,\
   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms\
   of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included\
   in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with\
   all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited\
   by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\
   detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\
\
5. Application of this License.\
\
   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\
   attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\
\
6. Versions of the License.\
\
   6.1. New Versions.\
\
      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish\
      revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each\
      version will be given a distinguishing version number.\
\
   6.2. Effect of New Versions.\
\
      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\
      the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of\
      that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under\
      the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\
      Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the\
      terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\
\
   6.3. Derivative Works.\
\
      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which\
      you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already\
      Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your\
      license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL",\
      "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase\
      do not appear in your license (except to note that your license\
      differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that\
      Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the\
      Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in\
      the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor\
      in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be\
      deemed to be modifications of this License.)\
\
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\
\
   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"\
   BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE\
   IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\
   NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\
   OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE\
   DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER\
   CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\
   CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART\
   OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER\
   EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\
\
8. TERMINATION.\
\
   8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\
      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\
      cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\
      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\
      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by\
      their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this\
      License shall survive.\
\
   8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim\
      (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or\
      a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You\
      file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:\
\
      (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\
          infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by\
          such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this\
          License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate\
          prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of\
          notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay Participant\
          a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and\
          future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)\
          withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor\
          Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice,\
          a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually\
          agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\
          is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You\
          under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the\
          expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\
\
      (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\
          Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any\
          patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant\
          under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of\
          the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,\
          Modifications made by that Participant.\
\
   8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\
      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly\
      or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved\
      (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of\
      patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the\
      licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2\
      shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of\
      any payment or license.\
\
   8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all\
      end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\
      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\
      prior to termination shall survive termination.\
\
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\
\
   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\
   (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\
   DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\
   OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\
   ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\
   CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\
   WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\
   COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\
   INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF\
   LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\
   RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE\
   LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\
   EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,\
   SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\
\
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\
\
   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined\
   in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer\
   software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as\
   such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent\
   with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4\
   (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with\
   only those rights set forth herein.\
\
11. MISCELLANEOUS.\
\
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\
   necessary to make it enforceable.\
\
   This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to\
   the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its\
   conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least\
   one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do\
   business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to\
   this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts\
   of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa\
   Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs,\
   including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'\
   fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\
   Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\
   Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\
   shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\
\
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\
\
   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\
   responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\
   out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree\
   to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\
   responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing herein is intended or\
   shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\
\
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\
\
   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code\
   as Multiple-Licensed.  Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial\
   Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\
   Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified\
   by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\

Perl 5.  Artistic License:\
==========================\
\
The Program includes some or all of the following that IBM obtained under the Artistic License (source code available via the indicated URL):" http://dev.perl.org/licenses/artistic.html\
\
- Perl 5.10.1\
\
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a\
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some\
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,\
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute\
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make\
reasonable modifications.\
\
Definitions:\
\
   "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the\
   Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files\
   created through textual modification.\
\
   "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been\
   modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes\
   of the Copyright Holder as specified below.\
\
   "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or\
   copyrights for the package.\
\
   "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing\
   this Package.\
\
   "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the\
   basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,\
   and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the\
   Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large\
   as a market that must bear the fee.)\
\
   "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item\
   itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.\
   It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it\
   under the same conditions they received it.\
\
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the\
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you\
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\
\
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications\
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package\
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\
\
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided\
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and\
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the\
following:\
\
    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them\
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or\
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive\
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include\
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\
\
    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\
\
    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict\
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide\
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly\
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\
\
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\
\
4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or\
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\
\
    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,\
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where\
    to get the Standard Version.\
\
    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of\
    the Package with your modifications.\
\
    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly\
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together\
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\
\
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\
\
5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this\
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this\
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,\
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly\
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software\
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a\
product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within\
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere\
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the\
interpreter is so embedded.\
\
6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as\
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall\
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated\
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this\
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this\
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a\
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall\
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it\
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do\
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this\
Package.\
\
7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other\
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to\
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this\
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the\
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do\
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the\
regression tests for the language.\
\
8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always\
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,\
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible\
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be\
construed as a distribution of this Package.\
\
9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote\
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\

Common Public License Version 1.0\
\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC\
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\
\
1. DEFINITIONS\
\
"Contribution" means:\
\
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\
\
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\
\
i) changes to the Program, and\
\
ii) additions to the Program;\
\
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\
derivative works of the Program.\
\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\
\
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\
combined with the Program.\
\
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\
\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\
\
including all Contributors.\
\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\
\
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such\
derivative works, in source code and object code form.\
\
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\
\
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to\
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\
before distributing the Program.\
\
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set\
forth in this Agreement.\
\
3. REQUIREMENTS\
\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\
own license agreement, provided that:\
\
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\
\
b) its license agreement:\
\
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and\
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\
fitness for a particular purpose;\
\
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\
damages, such as lost profits;\
\
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered\
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\
\
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or\
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\
\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\
\
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\
\
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\
\
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\
Program.\
\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\
originator of the Contribution.\
\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\
\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages\
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\
any such claim at its own expense.\
\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\
Contributor must pay those damages.\
\
5. NO WARRANTY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\
\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
7. GENERAL\
\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\
provision valid and enforceable.\
\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\
survive.\
\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve\
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the\
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its\
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections\
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\
\
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\
any resulting litigation.\

      source, and configuration files.\
\
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\
      and conversions to other media types.\
\
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\
\
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\
\

      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\
\
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\
      meet the following conditions:\

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\
\
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\
          stating that You changed the files; and\
\
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\
          the Derivative Works; and\
\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\
          as modifying the License.\
\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\
      the conditions stated in this License.\
\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\
\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\
\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\
\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\
\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\

\
2.2. Contributor Grant.\
\
Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\
\
(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\

\
3. Distribution Obligations.\
3.1. Availability of Source Code.\
\
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\
\
3.2. Modifications.\
\
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\
\
3.3. Required Notices.\
\
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\
\
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\
\
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\
\
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\
\
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\
\
3.6. Larger Works.\
\
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\
\
4. Versions of the License.\
4.1. New Versions.\
\
Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.\
\
4.2. Effect of New Versions.\
\
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\
\
4.3. Modified Versions.\
\
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\
\
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\
\
6. TERMINATION.\
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\
\
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\
\
6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\
\
6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\
\
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\
\
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\
The Covered Software is a "commercial item" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\
\
9. MISCELLANEOUS.\
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys?'" fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\
\
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\
\
NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)\
\
The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.\

Medusa, the asynchronous communications framework upon which\
supervisor's server and client code is based, was created by Sam\
Rushing:\
\
  Medusa was once distributed under a 'free for non-commercial use'\
  license, but in May of 2000 Sam Rushing changed the license to be\
  identical to the standard Python license at the time.  The standard\
  Python license has always applied to the core components of Medusa,\
  this change just frees up the rest of the system, including the http\
  server, ftp server, utilities, etc.  Medusa is therefore under the\
  following license:\

      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\
      and conversions to other media types.\

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\
\
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\
\
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\
          the Derivative Works; and\
\
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\

          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\
          as modifying the License.\
\
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\
      the conditions stated in this License.\
\
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\
\
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\
\
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\
\
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\
\
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\

Minizip 1.1\
\
IBM obtained the right to use the software under the following license from MiniZip:\
\
MiniZip - Copyright (c) 1998-2010 - by Gilles Vollant - version 1.1 64 bits from Mathias Svensson\
\
Introduction\
---------------------\
MiniZip 1.1 is built from MiniZip 1.0 by Gilles Vollant ( http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html )\
\
When adding ZIP64 support into minizip it would result into risk of breaking compatibility with minizip 1.0.\
All possible work was done for compatibility.\
\
\
\
Background\
---------------------\
When adding ZIP64 support Mathias Svensson found that Even Rouault have added ZIP64 \
support for unzip.c into minizip for a open source project called gdal ( http://www.gdal.org/ )\
\
That was used as a starting point. And after that ZIP64 support was added to zip.c\
some refactoring and code cleanup was also done.\
\
\
Changed from MiniZip 1.0 to MiniZip 1.1\
---------------------------------------\
* Added ZIP64 support for unzip ( by Even Rouault )\
* Added ZIP64 support for zip ( by Mathias Svensson )\
* Reverted some changed that Even Rouault did.\
* Bunch of patches received from Gulles Vollant that he received for MiniZip from various users.\
* Added unzip patch for BZIP Compression method (patch create by Daniel Borca)\
* Added BZIP Compress method for zip\
* Did some refactoring and code cleanup\

\
IBM obtained the right to use the software under the following license from MiniZip:\
\
MiniZip - Copyright (c) 1998-2010 - by Gilles Vollant - version 1.1 64 bits from Mathias Svensson\
\
Introduction\
---------------------\
MiniZip 1.1 is built from MiniZip 1.0 by Gilles Vollant ( http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html )\
\
When adding ZIP64 support into minizip it would result into risk of breaking compatibility with minizip 1.0.\
All possible work was done for compatibility.\
\
\
Background\
---------------------\
When adding ZIP64 support Mathias Svensson found that Even Rouault have added ZIP64 \
support for unzip.c into minizip for a open source project called gdal ( http://www.gdal.org/ )\
\
That was used as a starting point. And after that ZIP64 support was added to zip.c\
some refactoring and code cleanup was also done.\
\
\
Changed from MiniZip 1.0 to MiniZip 1.1\
---------------------------------------\
* Added ZIP64 support for unzip ( by Even Rouault )\
* Added ZIP64 support for zip ( by Mathias Svensson )\
* Reverted some changed that Even Rouault did.\
* Bunch of patches received from Gulles Vollant that he received for MiniZip from various users.\
* Added unzip patch for BZIP Compression method (patch create by Daniel Borca)\
* Added BZIP Compress method for zip\
* Did some refactoring and code cleanup\

            (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes or otherwise makes the Original Software available to a third party under the terms of this License.\
\
            (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original Software, or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original Software with other software or devices.\
\
        2.2. Contributor Grant.\
\
        Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\

\
            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).\

\
    3. Distribution Obligations.\
\
        3.1. Availability of Source Code.\
\
        Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\
\
        3.2. Modifications.\
\
        The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\
\
        3.3. Required Notices.\
\
        You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\
\
        3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\
\
        You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\
\
        3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\
\
        You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\
\
        3.6. Larger Works.\
\
        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\
\
    4. Versions of the License.\
\
        4.1. New Versions.\
\
        Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.\
\
        4.2. Effect of New Versions.\
\
        You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\
\
        4.3. Modified Versions.\
\
        When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\
\
    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\
\
    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\
\
    6. TERMINATION.\
\
        6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\
\
        6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\
\
        6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\
\
    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\
\
    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\
\
    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\
\
    The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\
\
    9. MISCELLANEOUS.\
\
    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\
\
    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\
\
    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\

\
    3. Distribution Obligations.\
\
        3.1. Availability of Source Code.\
\
        Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\
\
\
        3.2. Modifications.\
\
        The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\
\
        3.3. Required Notices.\
\
        You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\
\
        3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\
\
        You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\
\
        3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\
\
        You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\
\
        3.6. Larger Works.\
\
        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\
\
    4. Versions of the License.\
\
        4.1. New Versions.\
\
        Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.\
\
        4.2. Effect of New Versions.\
\
        You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\
\
        4.3. Modified Versions.\
\
        When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\
\
    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\
\
    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\
\
    6. TERMINATION.\
\
        6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\
\
        6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\
\
        6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\
\
    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\
\
    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\
\
    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\
\
    The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\
\
    9. MISCELLANEOUS.\
\
    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\
\
    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\
\
    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\

\
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC\
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\
\
1. DEFINITIONS\
\
"Contribution" means:\
\
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\
\
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\
\
    i) changes to the Program, and\
\
    ii) additions to the Program;\
\
    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\
derivative works of the Program.\
\
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\
\
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\
combined with the Program.\
\
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\
\
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\
including all Contributors.\
\
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\
\
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such\
derivative works, in source code and object code form.\
\
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\
\
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to\
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\
before distributing the Program.\
\
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set\
forth in this Agreement.\
\
3. REQUIREMENTS\
\
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\
own license agreement, provided that:\
\
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\
\
    b) its license agreement:\
\
    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and\
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\
fitness for a particular purpose;\
\
    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\
damages, such as lost profits;\
\
    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered\
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\
\
    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or\
through a medium customarily used for software exchange. \
\
When the Program is made available in source code form:\
\
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\
\
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. \
\
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\
Program.\
\
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\
originator of the Contribution.\
\
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\
\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages\
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\
any such claim at its own expense.\
\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\
Contributor must pay those damages.\
\
5. NO WARRANTY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\
\
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\
\
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\
\
7. GENERAL\
\
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\
provision valid and enforceable.\
\
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\
\
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\
survive.\
\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve\
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the\
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its\
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections\
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\
\
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\
any resulting litigation.\

\
        3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\
\
        You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\
\
        3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\

If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\
\
        3.6. Larger Works.\
\
        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\
\
    4. Versions of the License.\
\
        4.1. New Versions.\
\
        Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.\
\
        4.2. Effect of New Versions.\
\
        You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\
\
        4.3. Modified Versions.\
\
        When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\
\
    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\
\
    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\
\
    6. TERMINATION.\
\
        6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\
\
        6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\
\
        6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\
\
    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\
\
    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\
\
    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\
\
    The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\
\
    9. MISCELLANEOUS.\
\
    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\
\
    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\
\
    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\

    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications available to a third party.\
    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.\
\
3. Distribution Obligations.\
\
    3.1. Availability of Source Code.\
    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\
\
    3.2. Modifications.\
    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\
\
    3.3. Required Notices.\
    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\
\
    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\
    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\
\
    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\
    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\
\
    3.6. Larger Works.\
    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\
\
4. Versions of the License.\
\
    4.1. New Versions.\
    Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.\
\
    4.2. Effect of New Versions.\
    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\
\
    4.3. Modified Versions.\
    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\
\
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\
    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\
\
6. TERMINATION.\
\
    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\
    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\
    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\
    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\
\
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\
    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\
\
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\
    The Covered Software is a "commercial item" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\
\
9. MISCELLANEOUS.\
    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\
\
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\
    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\
\
NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)\
The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. \

\
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\

\
3. Distribution Obligations.\
\
    3.1. Availability of Source Code.\
    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\
\
    3.2. Modifications.\
    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\
\
    3.3. Required Notices.\
    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\
\
    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\
    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\
\
    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\
    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\
\
    3.6. Larger Works.\
    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\
\
4. Versions of the License.\
\
    4.1. New Versions.\

\
    4.2. Effect of New Versions.\
    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\
\
    4.3. Modified Versions.\
    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\
\
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\
    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\
\
6. TERMINATION.\
\
    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\
    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\
    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\
    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\
\
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\
    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\
\
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\
    The Covered Software is a "commercial item" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\
\
9. MISCELLANEOUS.\
    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\
\
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\
    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\
\
NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)\

\
Technology Preview Code (TPC) may be included or distributed with the Program or updates to it but are not part of the Program. TPC is licensed under the same terms as the Program, except as provided below. \
TPC will be identified as such in the Notices File (or in an updated Notices File accompanying the updates). Some or all of the TPC may not be made generally available by IBM as or in a product. Licensee is permitted to use TPC only for internal use for evaluation purposes and not for use in a production environment. \
The Notices File may limit this evaluation use to an evaluation period. If so, at the end of such evaluation period Licensee must cease using and uninstall the TPC. IBM provides the TPC without obligation of support and "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
Licensee may not transfer TPC to another party except as a transfer accompanying the Program. TPC may contain a disabling device that will prevent it from being used after the evaluation period ends. Licensee will not tamper with this disabling device or the TPC. \
Licensee should take precautions to avoid any loss of data that might result when the TPC can no longer be used.\
Licensee assigns to IBM all right, title, and interest (including ownership of copyright) in any\
data, suggestions, or written materials that 1) are related to the Technology Preview Code and 2) Licensee provides to IBM. Upon IBM's request, Licensee will sign additional documents necessary to assign such rights. In addition to the foregoing, Licensee grants to IBM a non-exclusive, irrevocable, unrestricted, worldwide and paid-up right and license to a) include in any product or service any idea, know-how, concept, technique, invention, discovery or improvement, whether or not patentable, that Licensee provides to IBM related to the Technology Preview Code b) use, manufacture and market any such product or service, and c) allow others to do any of the foregoing.\
Licensee agrees to treat the following as "IBM Confidential Information" regardless of whether they contain restrictive markings indicating the confidential nature thereof or have been identified as IBM Confidential Information prior to disclosure: \
(a) the Technology Preview Code, (b) any information provided to Licensee by IBM with regard to the Technology Preview Code including, but not limited to, related materials such as specifications, plans, trends, strategies, benchmarks, performance characteristics, comparisons and other assessments of the Technology Preview Code, (c) any information related to Licensee's access to the Technology Preview Code including, but not limited to, passwords or other access codes, and (d) all data, feedback, suggestions and/or written materials that Licensee provides to IBM related to the Technology Preview Code. \
Licensee is authorized to use the IBM Confidential Information for the purpose for which it was disclosed or otherwise for the benefit of IBM. Notwithstanding any other terms of this Agreement, Licensee agrees not to communicate, publish, disseminate or otherwise discuss with or disclose to any third party the IBM Confidential Information (including but not limited to articles, papers or other written materials pertaining to the IBM Confidential Information) prior to IBM making such IBM Confidential Information publicly available without a non-disclosure obligation. Notwithstanding the above, Licensee does not have a confidentiality obligation to Technology Preview Code identified in the Notices File as non-confidential.\
Licensee agrees to use the same care and discretion to avoid disclosure of the IBM Confidential Information as Licensee uses with Licensee's own similar information that Licensee does not wish to disclose, but in no event will such degree of care be less than reasonable care. \
Licensee's obligations with respect to the IBM Confidential Information will continue for a period of two years from Licensee's receipt of the IBM Confidential Information. Licensee agrees not to disclose to IBM any information that is considered confidential or proprietary to Licensee or any third party except under a signed, separate, written confidential agreement.\
Notwithstanding the existence of any confidentiality or other agreement Licensee may have with IBM pertaining to confidential information, the preceding paragraphs will govern the treatment of the IBM Confidential Information.\
