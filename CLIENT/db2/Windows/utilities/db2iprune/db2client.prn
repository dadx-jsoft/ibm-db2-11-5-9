** Sample response file for db2iprune
** ----------------------------------
** 
** Pruning can reduce the size of the product installation image prior to installing 
** the DB2 product by removing unneeded components, languages or products from the 
** media.  The result is a new, smaller DB2 installation image that can be installed 
** using the regular DB2 installation methods.
**
** To select features to prune, enable the corresponding keywords.
** Comments are made by placing either an asterisk (*) or a number sign (#) at
** the start of a line, or by placing ** or ## after the start of a line to
** comment out the rest of that line.
**
** For more information on how to use db2iprune, see the topic
